      <p>This assignment is simply meant as an exercise in opening Photoshop and playing around. The idea is to get comfortable getting around the program and making marks. I am not expecting masterpieces so don&#39;t feel the pressure to make something awesome. The assignment will not be graded, however I do want you to turn in something. </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Create a new file in Photoshop - 5 inches by 7 inches at 72 pixels per inch, RGB 8 Bit. You will plug these numbers in in the dialog box that opens after you go to <strong>File &gt; New</strong>.

          </figure>
        </li>
        <li>Please create a self-portrait using the tools in Photoshop. The image doesn&#39;t need to be a selfie of your face, you can create a metaphorical self-portrait that captures something interesting about you. You can alter a photograph, or create an image using the paintbrush, or some combination of both. </li>
        <li>As you are working, be sure to save your work often. The default Photoshop document file format will be a .psd which saves your layers and settings. This is a construction file that can be edited and changed whenever you want. You usually won&#39;t be turning these files in for grading because D2L has a limit to file sizes, however you will still want to hang on to them for possible future use. </li>
        <li>When you are through creating save the file to your computer as a flattened .jpg file format by going to <strong>File &gt; SaveAs</strong> and changing the format to .jpg. Title the image with your last name and 1st initial of your first name, and the number of the lesson. For example, if I were to save this file I would save it titled <strong>BennettC-Assignment1.jpg</strong>.</li>
        <li>Use the assignment dropbox in D2L to turn in your jpg image. Go to <strong>Assessments &gt; Assignments</strong> to find the dropbox or use the link in the weekly folder. </li>

      </ol>
      <p>If you run into issues or have questions, please ask them on the discussion forum or send me an email through D2L. </p>
