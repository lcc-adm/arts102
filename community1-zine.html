          href="https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&amp;q=90s%20zine&amp;tbs=imgo:1" target="_blank" title="opens in new tab">Back in the 90s, zines were the rage in
          counter-culture self-publishing.</a> You created your own magazine and
        ran off copies at the local Kinkos. It was a way to spread information
        before the internet. It was a way to get your voice out there.
        Underground bands and skaters made good use of them, as did conspiracy
        theorists and Riot Grrrl feminists. Even your old teacher was known for
        some of his zines (and homemade postcards).</p>
      <p>One of my favorite inspirational people is <a
          href="https://austinkleon.com/" target="_blank" title="opens in new tab">Austin Kleon</a>.
        He's made <a href="https://austinkleon.com/tag/zines/" target="_blank" title="opens in new tab">a lot of mini-zines</a>. I want you to make one
        in his style this week. They are meant to be quick and loose and not at
        all precious. They are an opportunity to play with an idea or to express
        an opinion. They are a chance to be creative in a way that isn't too
        caught up in being perfect. Seems like a good thing to get you back into
        the creative flow.</p>
      <p>I'm almost completely open to whatever you want to make for your zine.
        Create a mini-comic book. Write a poem. List what you've been doing
        duringlockdown. List what you wish you could have been doing during
        lockdown. Illustrate your favorite foods. Give yourself permission to
        play. It could be funny or sad or silly or meaningful. Use it to
        complain about the plague or dream of a different world. It is your
        chance to say what you want. <strong>Just make something interesting
          that has something to say about life and your perception of
          it.</strong></p>
      <p>I'm also open to styles and techniques. Collage bits and pieces. Draw
        in different ways. Use a typewriter for text (if you have access to
        one). Paint with watercolor or coffee. Use material and sew them. Use
        stickers in weird ways. You get the idea. <strong>Just play!</strong>
      </p>
      <h2>how to make a zine</h2>
      <p>All it takes to make this type of zine is a sheet of paper and a pair
        scissors. Actually, the scissors are not even a requirement. You can
        just rip the paper a bit instead.</p>
      <p>Austin Kleon has <a href="https://youtu.be/ab4O9SWNl9g" target="_blank" title="opens in new tab">a video</a> on how to make one. Here's <a
          href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1c8JVA14MvvHzR8j-FgqQoQ9W6nWysEbg/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank" title="opens in new tab">a low-budget instruction sheet</a>. I'm sure you
        can find more alternatives online.</p>
      <p>If you would prefer to work digitally, here's <a
          href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1r4bM4pvVmvLAZNbDV34c7hfBhe2BJWmH/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank" title="opens in new tab">a Photoshop template</a> to use. The text layer
        is just to show you how the spreads work. You can turn that layer off.
        For those of you who don't have Photoshop, here's <a
          href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1G2erVPdC3BIgfJ2gY6EtEypmd_YDlSej/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank" title="opens in new tab">a flat template with the spreads</a> and <a
          href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WNtthAONm2EdMiJfqUV3EzZDQAZJqa8G/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank" title="opens in new tab">a flat template without the spreads</a> to
        actually use. When done, print, fold, and cut.</p>

          art zines</a> for inspiration. No matter what, you will find that the
        focus is on ideas and not necessarily artistic quality. Of course, make
        yours as awesome as you can!</p>

      <h2>ASSIGNMENT SUBMISSION</h2>
      <p>To turn in your assignment, take some pictures of your zine. Show
        covers and pages. Post them on <a href="#">the discussion forum</a> for
        everyone to see. Give us a short intro so we know what we are looking
        at.</p>
      <p>I'm not requiring anyone to post comments on each others work, but feel
        free to compliment and support each other. It is that sense of community
        that we're trying to build. Do what you can to participate in the
        community conversation.</p>
    </div>

    <div class=" col-half-right topline">
      <h2>ASSIGNMENT EVALUATION</h2>
      <p>I'm not going to grade these zines. I'm just going to enjoy them. I
        might give some feedback. Mostly, I just want you to make something. You
        get full points for making and sharing them.</p>
