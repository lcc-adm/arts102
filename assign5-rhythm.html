      <h2>OBJECTIVES</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>to use the principle of Rhythm to create images that visually communicate rhythm in a composition.</li>
        <li>to explore and utilize repetition, balance and color within a composition.</li>
        <li>to continue to become familiar with the software Photoshop and its various tools.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>ASSIGNMENT</h2>
      <p><em>Please read the <a href='#'>Rhythm Ebook</a> before starting this assignment.</em></p>
      <p>Using the principles learned thus far in Design and Communications, you will create a graphic image that best express the visual rhythms of the following four themes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Lazy River</strong> <em>- gentle legato flow</em></li>
        <li><strong>Idling Harley-Davidson</strong> <em>- mechancial staccato repetition</em></li>
        <li><strong>Seismic Event</strong> <em>- chaotic staccato, explosions, earthquakes, etc.</em></li>
        <li><strong>Slow Dancing</strong> <em>- probably legato, but you might be an awkward staccato dancer</em></li>

      </ul>
      <p>Consider the character of the event, and match your rhythmic style to it. You will need to create balanced, unified compositions that have rhythm and no focal point. </p>
      <p>This is purely a design problem, but you must <strong>NOT</strong> use representational forms. I don&#39;t want to see a motorcycle or people dancing. Go for the <strong><em>feeling</em></strong> of the rhythm. It helps to listen to relevant music while creating each piece. Feel free to be as creative as you wish, and to use other tools or options within the parameters of the exercise. </p>
      <p>Below are some ideas to keep in mind while working through the assignment:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>You must use Unity in the image. Unity can be achieved by repetition, rhythm, similarity, or continuity.</li>
        <li>You must use Rhythm in the image. Rhythm can be achieved by linear repetition and by repeated shapes.</li>
        <li>You must achieve Symmetrical, Asymmetrical, and Radial Balance in three separate images.</li>
        <li>Balance can be achieved by creating by balancing of the visual weights within the image.</li>
        <li>Lack of Emphasis can be created by reducing contrast and by repetitive or rhythmic placement.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Below are examples of digital sketches and a finished image for each theme:</p>

      <h2>SOFTWARE TIPS</h2>
      <p>Hopefully by now you are feeling more comfortable with creating in Photoshop. This assignment has the potential to be very different than what you have done so far, both in terms of content and Photoshop technique. I encourage you to explore deeper into Photoshop tools or try new approaches.</p>
      <p>One potential way of approaching the assignment is to simply draw out the patterns using the Brush tool. Photoshop ships with many cool and interesting brushes that go beyond basic clean lines (Window &gt; Brushes). Play with colors and paint out the marks. </p>
      <p>Once you have some marks, you can use Filters to modify those marks in new and interesting ways. Go to the Filter pull-down menu to find your options. The Filter Gallery has tons of cool effects. </p>
      <p>Here is another potential way of approaching the assignment:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Begin each problem by filling each square with a background color.</li>
        <li>Using the rectangular selection tool select and fill vertical or horizontal bars of two or three different colors on the background.</li>
        <li>You can then use Photoshop Filters to create your rhythmic images. A good way to begin is Filter &gt; Distort &gt; Twirl &gt; Shear.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>Finally, you can play with Layer Blending to mix different layers together. Make different marks on different layers. Choose the top layer. At the top of the Layers Palette you will see a pull-down that says <strong>Normal</strong> by default. Play around with the different options to see how that layer changes how it blends with the layers below. Right next to that option is a setting for <strong>Opacity</strong>. This is as setting for tansparent/opague a layer is. 100% is fully opague, 0% is fully transparent, but levels inbetween are partially transparent. This is a good way to build up layers like you would in painting. </p>

      <p>Have fun exploring!! </p>

      <p>These instructions will help you get started on this assignment. Please refer to the Photoshop Resources page for more Photoshop help. You can always send me an email or ask for help on the discussion forum if you run into problems. </p>

      <h2>SUBMITTING WORK</h2>
      <h3>ARTWORK</h3>
      <p>When finished with your designs, create a flattened .jpg file format. You can then upload the files in the <a href='#'>Lesson 5 dropbox</a>. In total you will submit 1 image file for this assignment, along with your written self-assessment in D2L. For example, I would save my files as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>bennettc_rhythm.jpg</li>
      </ul>


      <h3>ANALYSIS</h3>
      <p>Each week, you will be asked to respond to questions regarding your artwork created for each project. Please fill out the self-directed analysis, by answering the questions below when submitting your work in D2L. </p>
      <p><em>Hint: sometimes D2L gets twitchy so I recommend writing your answers in your favorite text editor (Word, Google Docs, etc.) and then copy/paste into the D2L comment box.</em> </p>
      <p><strong>Self-Directed Analysis:</strong></p>
      <ol>
        <li>Explain how the elements of unity, balance and lack of emphasis were used to create rhythm in the images.</li>
        <li>Explain which principles of the Gestalt theory have been used and where they were used in your concepts.</li>
        <li>Do your images meet the project parameters? Please explain how each of the four concepts visually represent the assigned topic and what type of rhythm is present in each image.</li>
        <li>What alternatives did you consider while doing this project?</li>

      </ol>
      <p>*Hint: These are terms that should be used in your analysis: rhythm, repetition, movement, legato, staccato, progressive rhythm,alternating rhythm, unity/harmony</p>

    </div>

    <div class='col-half-right'>
      <h3>CRITIQUE</h3>
      <p>You will create a new post on the <a href='#'>Lesson 5 Discussion Forum</a>. In this post you will upload the .jpg version of your favorite design and then tell us a little bit about what you created. You don&#39;t need to give the full formal breakdown that you wrote out in the analysis, however I would like you to use the vocab to explain what you were trying to do and if you think you were successful. </p>
      <p>As a way to continue your learning and appreciation of the concepts, you will read and respond to at least two of your classmate&#39;s posts. It helps to see how they responded to the same design prompts you were working with. Your critique may help them to see the ideas in a different light. Plus this is another chance for you to use the vocabulary in a slightly different context. </p>
      <p>At the very least, answer the following questions: Was the design successful in creating a graphic image that communicates the meaning of the concepts? How was this achieved? What is working particularly well in the design? </p>

      <h2>EVALUATION</h2>
      <p>The project is worth 20 points. </p>
      <p>The evaluation is based on:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>ORGANIZATION / FORMAT: Imagery is organized in a clear, appropriate and precise manner. Images are unified by repetition, rhythm, similarity, and/or continuity. 2 points.</li>
        <li>EMPHASIS: Imagery does not have a clearly defined focal point. 2 points.</li>
        <li>BALANCE: A correct interpretation of symmetrical, asymmetrical, and radial balance. Imagery engages the picture plane. 2 points.</li>
        <li>RHYTHM: Internal design dynamics support the intended imagery. Rhythm is present through repetition of lines, shapes, or negative space. 2 points.</li>
        <li>SELF-DIRECTED ANALYSIS: Thoughtful evaluation of relevant issues correctly using the language of design. 2 points.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><em>Note the discussion forum posts and critiques are part of a separate assignment grade.</em> </p>
