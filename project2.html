      <p><strong>You will be creating a propaganda poster advocating for a cause
          you choose that explores the design principles of Rhythm, Line, and
          Shape.</strong></p>

      <p>You will create a Propaganda Poster on an 11” x 17” document,
        horizontal or vertical, your choice of orientation. You will research
        the idea of Propaganda Posters for ideas and thematic choices based on
        your personal beliefs and preferences. Take a stand and convince others
        through your art.</p>
      <p>Your topic can be deep and meaningful such as advocating for an End To
        War or an End To Racism, but it can also be silly and light, such as
        advocating for Pizza for Breakfast or Taco Tuesday to become a weekly
        national holiday. Your poster can be positive by calling for something
        good to happen, such as Free College For All or it can be negative by
        calling for the banning of something like No More Single-Use Plastic.

      <h3>research propaganda inspiration</h3>
      <p>Take the time to familiarize yourself with how propaganda posters have
        been created. There is a rich history of quality graphic design for both
        positive and negative propaganda. Most people think of the posters from
        the world wars, however protest posters from Vietnam can be just as
        powerful. More recently, look at protest posters from Black Lives Matter
        or Gay Pride. Politics, of course, have a strong history of posters and
        symbolism as well. Just look at the most recent Biden/Trump election
        cycle for examples.</p>
      <p>Graphically, you can examine the work of by Steve Shepard, Jenny
        Holzer, Barbara Kruger as inspirational examples. Also, Google Images
        can be your friend.</p>

      <h3>topic and storytelling considerations</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Choose a topic that piques your interest, or evokes a strong emotion
          for you as an artist.</li>
        <li>Choose a social or political quote from your topic that evokes
          your/your reader’s emotion the best. Create a meaningful slogan</li>
        <li>Make sure your information is reliable.</li>
        <li>Depict your statement on a poster through the use of imagery and
          text.</li>
        <li>Your image should be an “in your face” style; the image should be
          large and possibly cropped, going off the edge of the paper or
          depicting an unusual angle or scene… Think about what point of view
          you want to depict.</li>
        <li>Add minimal text (See art of Barbara Kruger) – or make it all about
          the words (see Jenny Holzer).</li>
        <li>Remember that the more text you use the more time it takes for the
          viewer to “get it”. Sometimes simple is best.</li>
        <li>Choose your color scheme carefully. You may want to choose a
          monochromatic color scheme (all blues, all reds, etc.)</li>
        <li>Research imagery of elements you wish to include in your poster.
        </li>
      </ul>

    <div class="col-double-left topline bottomline">
      <h3>agreement to be open-minded</h3>
      <p>As we work on these posters it is important to remember that we will be
        sharing a variety of points of view. We do not have to agree with the
        topic to be able to evaluate the work. In your research, you may find
        posters with topics you find distasteful, but you can still appreciate
        them for their graphic design potential. For example, the Nazis were
        horrible people and we should rightly judge them negatively, however
        their graphic design and presentation of messaging was quite well done.
      </p>
      <p>Similarly, choose topics that you feel strongly about even if that
        means potentially offending someone else. These posters do not need to
        be politically correct or non-offensive. The point of propaganda is to
        take a side on a topic which will naturally upset others on the opposite
        side. That being said, be consciously aware of what you are saying and
        how it is being said. Be sure there is a meaningful reason for your
        design.</p>
      <p>Also be aware that others may be creating posters that you find
        upsetting. Please keep an open mind about this. We don't need to agree
        on content, but we do need to agree to keep an open mind and be
        accepting of alternative viewpoints. </p>

      <h2>principles &amp; elements</h2>
      <p>In addition to exploring the social aspects of propaganda, you will
        also
        be exploring how to use the design principles in visual design. Your
        understanding of design concepts will lead to a stronger visual message.
      </p>
      <p>Do not forget the lessons from the previous project. You should still
        be aware of how you use unity, balance, and emphasis in your designs. Even
        though you are not necessarily being graded on them specifically, they
        still affect your design.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="col-single-left white-box">
      <h3>rhythm</h3>
      <p>The principle of Rhythm is about using repetition of elements to create
        a
        sense of flow. The repetition can be used to create regular patterns for
        textures or it could be used to create movement to guide the viewer's
        eye
        across the page. The repeated hands scaling up in size creates a solid
        sense of movement and power in the composition.</p>
      <p>You can also use repetition of elements to build a sense of unity
        through
        the consistent colors or objects. For example, the repeated hands
        holding
        money creates a sense of community with the green color alluding to the
        color of dollar bills.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-single-mid white-box">
      <h3>line</h3>
      <p>The principle of Line is about the actual physical lines in the
        illustration, such as the outlines of the hands holding money in the
        image. The lines are strong and straight, but have some variation in
        width
        which adds character. You can see that lines and shapes often have
        considerable overlap in presentation. The lines of the bills have a
        lower
        contrast and are there to illustrate money, as well as to create
        repeated
        elements that form a strong line moving upward. The background buildings
        are faded out, but still have repeated shapes that build lines moving
        upward. Everything feels powerful and strong, which is the point of the
        piece.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-single-right white-box">
      <h3>shape</h3>
      <p>The principle of Shape is about building objects that have mass and
        takes
        up space. Lines can outline a shape, of course, but a solid mass of
        color
        or texture has considerably more visual weight. Shapes can be solid or
        made up of smaller elements (proximity). Shapes can be repeated to
        create
        implied lines or visual rhythms. In the poster, the bold shapes of money
        dominate the scene. The hands are also emphasized, but it is the money
        that captures the attention. The repetition of those elements builds a
        flow that moves upward in a powerful way. The bold font creates strong
        letter shapes that form a solid base to the composition that
        communicates
        the message in a very literal way.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="col-double-left">
      <h2>process</h2>
      <h3>pre-planning &amp; research</h3>
      <p>The first step is to figure out what you want to say and how you would
        like to possibly go about saying it. You don't need to formally answer
        these questions however it is worthwhile to consider the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>What is the topic of your project?</li>
        <li>How is it relevant to you?</li>
        <li>What type of imagery do you plan to use?</li>
        <li>Where will you get your imagery?</li>
        <li>How will you tell your story with imagery &amp; composition?</li>
        <li>What will you title your composition?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Of course, you do not need to have answers to these questions from the
        start. Use the questions to guide your preliminary explorations. Spend
        time researching both propaganda in general and your topic specifically.
        See what has been done before and let that influence what you choose to
        do. Collect example images of styles or techniques you like. Find images
        for things that you will need for your poster, such as a pro-coffee
        poster would potentially need images of coffee cups, coffee makers,
        coffee houses, coffee packaging, hipsters and &quot;cool&quot; people.
        Maybe pictures of cookies, scones, muffins, tea stuff, etc.</p>

    <div class="col-double-left">
      <h3>design activities</h3>
      <p>These are the sketches and doodles and other visual explorations where
        you experiment with your different ideas. Play around with positioning
        of elements, colors, slogans, etc. Break out your markers and colored
        pencils to build color schemes. Print out images from your computer and
        color on top of them. <strong>Be sure to specifically study how rhythm,
          line,
          and shape will be used to build your visual statement.</strong></p>
      <p>You are not limited to purely traditional methods for exploring ideas.
        You can use Photoshop or other digital art tools to try things out. Keep
        things in layers and move them around the screen. Make things bigger or
        smaller. Shift colors. Try out fonts. Play with filters.</p>
      <p>A blend of type and image is preferred. You may use color or stick with
        black and white imagery (perhaps mostly b&amp;w with a good splash of
        color for emphasis?). Keep readability in mind. Fonts choices matter to
        sell the idea. Check out <a

          target="_blank" title="opens in new tab">free
          fonts for commercial use</a> for new fonts you probably don't have
        installed on your computer. I really like <a
          href="http://www.fontsquirrel.com/" target="_blank"
          title="opens in new tab">font squirrel</a> as a starting
        place.</p>
      <p>Building off Project 1, think of this poster as a controlled collage of
        elements for a specific purpose. Keeping that collage mentality during
        your process can help you find a good composition and visual statement.

      <h3>final poster</h3>
      <p><strong>Your final digital file will be a Photoshop file that is
          11&quot;
          x 17&quot; RGB color mode set to 72ppi.</strong></p>
      <p>Beyond that, there are no real limits here. Make something meaningful
        with the tools and skills you have at your disposal. You may not achieve
        museum-quality work and that is fine. Grading is primarily on
        utilization
        of design principles and making a creative statement.</p>
