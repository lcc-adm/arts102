      <h2>ASSIGNMENT</h2>
      <p>You will create a Propaganda Poster on an 11&#x201D; x 17&#x201D; document, horizontal or vertical, your choice of orientation. You will research the idea of Propaganda Posters for ideas and thematic choices based on your personal beliefs and preferences. Choose wisely, based on your style.</p>

      <h3>RESEARCH</h3>
      <p>This is a critical step. The Poster can and should contain interesting information of your choice that is inspiring for you regarding your selected topic.</p>
      <p>Examine the work of by Steve Shepard, Jenny Holzer, Barbara Kruger as inspirational examples.</p>

        <li><a href="https://designschool.canva.com/blog/examples-of-propaganda/" target="_blank">https://designschool.canva.com/blog/examples-of-propaganda/</a></li>
        <li>Search Google Images for <a href="https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&amp;q=vintage%20propagana%20posters&amp;tbs=imgo:1" target="_blank">Vintage Propaganda Posters</a></li>
      </ul>

      <h3>CREATIVE STEPS</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Choose a topic that piques your interest, or evokes a strong emotion for you as an artist.</li>
        <li>Choose a social or political quote from your topic that evokes your/your reader&#x2019;s emotion the best.</li>
        <li>Make sure your information is reliable.</li>
        <li>Depict your statement on a poster through the use of imagery and text.</li>
        <li>Your image should be an &#x201C;in your face&#x201D; style; the image should be large and possibly cropped, going off the edge of the paper or depicting an unusual angle or scene&#x2026; Think about what point of view you want to depict.</li>
        <li>Add minimal text (See art of Barbara Kruger) &#x2013; or make it all about the words (see Jenny Holzer).</li>
        <li>Remember that the more text you use the more time it takes for the viewer to &#x201C;get it&#x201D;. Sometimes simple is best.</li>
        <li>Choose your color scheme carefully. You may want to choose a monochromatic color scheme (all blues, all reds, etc.)</li>
        <li>Research imagery of elements you wish to include in your poster.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>PLAN &amp; DESIGN</h3>
      <p>Please keep in mind:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A blend of type and image is preferred</li>
        <li>You may use color or stick with black and white</li>
        <li>Keep readability in mind - Fonts choices matter to sell the idea</li>
        <li>Use unity, emphasis, balance, rhythm and line in this assignment</li>
      </ul>
      <p>And remember&#x2026;</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Unity can be achieved by repetition, rhythm, proximity, similarity, continuity, color, or the use of grids</li>
        <li>Balance can be achieved by creating symmetry or by balancing the visual weights within the image</li>
        <li>Repetition can be achieved by use of repeating shapes, and/or alternating values</li>
        <li>Rhythm can be achieved by repetition and by repeated shapes</li>
        <li>Emphasis can be created by contrast, placement or isolation</li>
        <li>Line can exist as precise contour, lost and found edges, or by gestural markings</li>
      </ul>
      <p><em>As we work on these posters it is important to remember that we will be sharing a variety of points of view. We do not have to agree with the topic to be able to evaluate the work.</em></p>

      <p><strong>You will begin by creating a new file in Photoshop that is 11&quot; x 17&quot; RGB color mode and is set to 72ppi.</strong></p>
      <p>Beyond this, be as free and creative as you can.</p>

      <h2>SUBMITTING WORK</h2>
      <h3>ARTWORK</h3>
      <p>When finished with your designs, create a flattened .jpg file format. You can then upload the files in the <a href="#">Midterm dropbox</a>. In total you will submit 1 image file for this assignment, along with your written self-assessment in D2L. For example, I would save my files as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>bennettc_propaganda.jpg</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>ANALYSIS</h3>
      <p>As a more involved project, you are expected to also include a more formal written analysis of your visual work when it is completed.</p>
      <p>Below, you will find an outline that will help you prepare a formal written document of your formal self-evaluation. This written portion of the assignment is critical. This paper should be a minimum of two pages, at 10 point type, double spaced. You should feel comfortable using the language of design within this paper to explain your topic, your artist, your methods and your experiences with the project.</p>
      <h3>Outline:</h3>

      <p><strong>A. Introduction of Topic</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Title</li>
        <li>Thesis statement - who/what is the paper about?</li>

        Answer these questions in your writing:</p>

        <li>What &#x2013; or who &#x2013; has influenced your decisions? What is the &#x201C;flip side&#x201D; of your issue? What might the other side have to say? Can you see their point of view?</li>
        <li>What is your reasoning for choosing your stand? Is your artwork intended to offend? Who would be offended? Does the artist have a right to offend?</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>C. Body of Topic: your poster design</strong><br>
        Answer these questions in your writing:</p>

        <li>Does it show effective use of Principles of Design as described above? How have you used the Principles of Design to enhance your message?</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>C. Conclusion</strong></p>

      <h3>DISCUSSION</h3>
      <p>This project will take a few weeks of work to develop. Instead of critiquing work, this week you are thinking through your preliminary ideas by writing a proposal for what you intend to explore. You will not necessarily be strictly held to creating what you propose here, the very nature of the creative process means that things will change as you work. It is good to get the ideas out and get feedback on them while you are just getting started.</p>
      <p>Please answer the following questions about you proposed project:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>What is the topic of your project?</li>
        <li>How is it relevant to you?</li>
        <li>What type of imagery do you plan to use?</li>
        <li>Where will you get your imagery?</li>
        <li>How will you tell your story with imagery &amp; composition?</li>
        <li>What will you title your composition?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>When finished, please respond to at least 2 of your classmates posts, providing comments or suggestions that will help with their project.</p>

      <h2>EVALUATION</h2>

      <p>The project is worth 50 points.</p>
      <p>The evaluation is based on:</p>
      <p><strong>ORGANIZATION/FORMAT: 15 points</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Imagery is organized in a clear, appropriate and precise manner. All elements balance within the image.</li>
        <li>Multiple images are clear and organized.</li>
        <li>Unity &#x2013; The image is unified through the use of a grid structure to align elements of the composition.</li>
        <li>Rhythm and repetition is used to draw the viewer into the image.</li>
        <li>Emphasis &#x2013; There is a focal point and supporting accent points throughout the image. The focal point could be a title or a specific graphic, map or chart.</li>
        <li>The focal point should be the topic of the poster.</li>
        <li>There is adequate empty space in the image to allow for clarity of data, images, and text.</li>
        <li>Type does not extend to the edges of the picture plane, but has breathing room (unless deliberately pushing text off the edges of the picture plane)</li>
        <li>Balance &#x2013; Image is balanced through visual weight.</li>
        <li>Color, if used, is restricted in number of colors used. (This is to create unity through repetition of color) Color is dispersed and balanced through visual weight.</li>
        <li>Type/Fonts &#x2013; Only one Font set is used. Font is appropriate to topic. (You would not use Comic Sans to relate statistics of casualties, for example)</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>CONTENT: 10 points.</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Imagery is clear, accurate, relevant, and appropriate to the message. Fonts support the imagery created. Photos, if used, are manipulated.</li>

        <li>Imagery is evidently based on selected theme, research and general observation.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>RESEARCH &amp; INTERPRET DATA /INFORMATION: 10 points.</strong></p>
