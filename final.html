      <h2>OBJECTIVES</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>To create a project that utilizes several of the design elements and principles discussed and learned throughout the semester.</li>
        <li>To create a written presentation in which the visual message communicated through the art is reinforced through a thorough discussion of the elements and principles of design that are utilized, in addition to the techniques used to create the final project.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>ASSIGNMENT</h2>
      <p>You will create a composition that is symbolic of your learning this semester in ARTS 102. You must utilize several of the principles and elements discussed throughout the semester and you must be able to present and explain your design concept on the designated date. Decide which elements and principles you will use and work into a unified composition. Or, you may find it easier to think of a project you'd like to do, THEN reflect on the design principles and element that we ve discussed and decided how these will be integrated in your final project. The door is wide open for your final project and the sky is the limit, so get creative and get busy.</p>

      <h2>SUBMITTING WORK</h2>
      <h3>ARTWORK</h3>
      <p>When finished with your designs, create a flattened .jpg file format. You can then upload the files in the <a href="#" target="_blank">Final dropbox</a>. In total you will submit 1 image file for this assignment, along with your written self-assessment in D2L. For example, I would save my files as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>bennettc_final.jpg</li>
      </ul>
      <hr />
      <h3>ANALYSIS</h3>
      <p>As a more involved project, you are expected to also include a more formal written analysis of your visual work when it is completed.</p>
      <p>Below, you will find an outline that will help you prepare a formal written document of your formal self-evaluation. This written portion of the assignment is critical. This paper should be a minimum of two pages, at 10 point type, double spaced. You should feel comfortable using the language of design within this paper to explain your topic, your artist, your methods and your experiences with the project.</p>
      <h3>Outline:</h3>
      <p><strong>A. Introduction of Topic</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Title</li>
        <li>Thesis statement - who/what is the paper about?</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>B. Body of Topic</strong>
        Address these ideas in your writing:</p>
      <ol start="2">
        <li>message/theme of your design and how that is visually communicated</li>
        <li>design principles utilized and how they reinforce the message</li>
        <li>design elements utilized and how they reinforce the message</li>
        <li>creation of the artwork, how did you go about creating the project and what techniques did you utilize</li>
      </ol>
      <p><strong>C. Conclusion</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Closing statement that summarizes and concludes the presentation.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>DISCUSSION - WEEK 6</h3>
      <p>This project will take a few weeks of work to develop. Instead of critiquing work, in this week's <a href="#" target="_blank">discussion forum</a> you are thinking through your preliminary ideas by writing a proposal for what you intend to explore. You will not necessarily be strictly held to creating what you propose here, the very nature of the creative process means that things will change as you work. I would like you to discuss what you are planning to do for your final project and why your choice of project is relevant to you. I would also like you to discuss how you envision the principles and elements working together to create your final project.</p>
      <p>When finished, please respond to at least 2 of your classmates posts, providing comments or suggestions that will help with their project.</p>
      <hr />
      <h3>DISCUSSION - WEEK 7</h3>
      <p>At the end of the project you will present your final work in a separate <a href="#" target="_blank">discussion forum</a>. Tell us about what you created and why it was important to you. Tell us how the process went and what you think about the final product.</p>
      <p>When finished, please respond to at least 2 of your classmates posts, providing comments on how you interepret their final work for the class.</p>
