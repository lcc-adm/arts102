      <p>Welcome to week 2 of your ARTS102 adventures. Now that we've gotten the first week introductions over, it is time to jump into the festivities.</p>
      <p>We'll be working on three projects this summer, each taking two weeks to complete. For the first week of a project, we will explore the design principles through ebooks, vocabulary sheets, and design activities. These activities are a practical application in the design principles as well as development work for the project.</p>
      <p>The second week will be spent refining the designs and crafting the actual projects. This will be production time used to make the art as amazing as you can. I will have demos and tutorials on how to make things in Photoshop for you next week so don't worry about any of that this week.</p>
      <p>For the first project, you will be making two digital collages. The project one assignment sheet has a lot of information explaining the project in more detail. There's a lot to read, most of which is stuff I would talk about in class. Since we aren't meeting in real time, this is the best we can do. Remember, this is a two week project and I've tried to break it up into pieces so it isn't overwhelming.  Take a look and let me know what you think.</p>
      <p>Since you will be generating a lot of files for your work in this class, I think it will be easiest to set up a shared Google Drive folder for you to submit all of your work rather than using the D2L dropbox. I've given you instructions on how to get these folders set up. If you have any issues, please let me know and I'll help you get it figured out.</p>
      <p>Like last week, it seems like there's a lot of work here. Take your time reading things over and getting a sense of what needs to be done. Plan out how to break this up into a few different sessions over several days. I think you'll find that it isn't too difficult.</p>
      <p><strong>all of this week's assignments are due by Sunday June 20.</strong></p>

      <h2>readings</h2>
      <p>Start by reading about the design principles we'll be covering on this project. Similar to the introduction ebook, you don't need to read every word, but give these a good deep skim. Read deeper on anything that interests you.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="#">unity ebook</a></li>
        <li><a href="#">balance ebook</a></li>
        <li><a href="#">emphasis ebook</a></li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="col-half-right white-box">
      <h2>vocab</h2>
      <p>Dig deeper into the concepts by exploring the vocabulary. You will need to write definitions and find representative imagery for the design principles. In addition to learning the ideas, you will be building your own study guides for the final exam at the end of the summer.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="#">unity vocab</a></li>
        <li><a href="#">balance vocab</a></li>
        <li><a href="#">emphasis vocab</a></li>
      </ul>
    </div>


    <div class="col-half-left white-box">
      <h2>design exercises</h2>
      <p>Start creating art to explore the concepts. These activities are the preliminary design explorations you use to develop ideas for Project 1.</p>
        <ul>
