      <p>For this week we will be diving into the world of design principles, in
        particular Unity and Emphasis and, of course, Photoshop. This week is an
        indication of what further weeks will be like: two design concepts with
        ebooks and related creative visual challenges.</p>
      <p>There&#39;s a fun balance between the two concepts this week:
        <strong>Unity</strong> is all about organizing visual elements so that
        everything fits together and <strong>Emphasis</strong> is all about
        making one of those elements stand out from the rest of the other
        elements. </p>
      <p>Both assignments are all about organizing elements into different
        compositions. Since you are just learning Photoshop, for the Unity
        designs you will work with simple rectangles. That should give you a
        nice intro to moving things around. For the Emphasis designs you will be
        creating and moving around text elements instead of simple rectangles.
        You will mostly use the same tools to do the work though. We&#39;re
        slowly adding complexity.</p>

        <p>My advice for you as you start exploring the concepts is to focus on being playful with your art. You are not expected to make perfect pieces ready for a gallery wall. Think of them as sketches and doodles that are messy and rough. The important thing is to see what you can do with the concepts. If you can let go of that perfection, then you will have much better time in this class. <a href="https://youtu.be/PbC4gqZGPSY" target="_blank" title="opens in new tab">Here's a great video from Ira Glass</a> with a message that it is ok if your work isn't that good. Just keep trying and making things. Your work will get better as you go. By the end of the semester you will surprise yourself with what you are capable of. </p>

      <p>Have fun and happy designing!</p>

      <h2>UNITY</h2>
      <p>Unity is about arranging all visual elements into a pleasing unified
        whole. You will need to look at both placement of individual elements
        and how they fit in relationship to other elements. Unity is the
        foundation of all other explorations you will be doing throughout this
        class. </p>

      <h2>EMPHASIS</h2>
      <p>With Emphasis, you are trying to make one element stand out from the
        rest of the composition. The big trick with Emphasis is to use Contrast
        in some form to make an element different from the rest. Ways to play
        include making one element isolated from the rest, making one element
        bigger or smaller than the rest, making one element square and
        rectilinear when the rest are round and soft. You get to discover other
        ways to add contrast and build Emphasis. </p>
