      <p>As a reminder, these weekly community design challenges are all about sharing ideas and explorations with each other. More importantly, they are about cultivating your own artistic sensibilities. They encourage you to be curious about the world around you and to look with fresh eyes at things that seem familiar.</p>
      <p>An important part of being an artist is connecting with your world, connecting with the muse, connecting with your curiosity. As artists, we deal directly with true experience and capture our adventures in some sort of tangible form to share with others. Our recorded experiences communicate the adventure and can take on the form of paintings, music, sketches, drawings, doodles, patterns, rhythms, dance, film, animation, etc. The experiences themselves can be physical adventures, emotional explorations, conceptual play, etc. Often times, the artistic experiential journey is one that delves into the unknown. It is an act of personal discovery.</p>
      <p>Your assignment for this artistâ€™s date is to <strong>go on a collection spree</strong>.</p>
      <p>Remember the Unity design principle we covered all those weeks ago? The idea is to many elements that have a consistent visual theme (ie all one color) or conceptual theme (ie a bunch of vehicles). I would like for you to reinforce that understanding by going out and taking <strong>pictures of at least five objects</strong> that fit into a theme.</p>
      <p>To keep this interesting, make your theme random and silly and oddly specific. For example, only blue coffee cups or only broken clothespins. Maybe dog collars of pets you don't own. Or maybe forks that have three tines instead of the typical four. Is there something in particular that you have an affinity for? Then maybe you go out collecting (with a camera).</p>
      <p>Also, please focus on objects for this challenge. Don't take pictures of sunsets or trees. Those are cool, of course, but too easy.</p>
      <p>I know many of you probably already have random collections of things like cacti and other succulents or posters of Michael Jackson or ketchup packets from different restaurants. Those can be a good starting place, however I would love for you to get out into the world to find more examples. Push yourself to go out to new locations and look in new places.</p>
      <p>An incomplete list of random places you could go explore:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>second-hand stores</li>
      <li>yard sales</li>
      <li>dollar stores</li>
      <li>your own closet</li>
      <li>your friend's refrigerators</li>
      <li>your neighbor's flower garden</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>ASSIGNMENT SUBMISSION</h2>
      <p>To turn in your assignment, you will simply write a post on <a
          href="#">the discussion forum</a> <em>(Communication tab)</em> telling
        us what you did and how it went. It would be great if you have some
        tangible, visual documentation to share. It could be a photo or a
        drawing or even a visual poem. Let the experience inspire you.</p>
      <p>I'm not requiring anyone to post comments on each others work, but feel
        free to compliment and support each other. It is that sense of community
        that we're trying to build. Do what you can to participate in the
        community conversation.</p>

      <h2>ASSIGNMENT EVALUATION</h2>
      <p>I'm not going to grade these. I'm just going to enjoy them. I might
        give some feedback. Mostly, I just want you to make something. You get
        full points for making and sharing them.</p>
