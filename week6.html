      <p>Hello all.</p>
      <p>We've finished the midterm and are now jumping immediately into the final project. Have to love the short summer session, huh?</p>
      <p>First, there are two final design assignments to complete this week. You will be exploring <strong>Value</strong> which is a study of the lights and darks in an image (not the perceived cost or cultural importance of a piece). You will be emulating a specific historical artist for your creative work on this assignment. You will also explore how changing <strong>Color</strong> can affect a design. In this assignment you will also be emulating historical artistic references. Both assignments are quite fun when you get into them.</p>
      <p>Happily, there are not many rules for the final project. You can choose to create just about anything you want to create; it is your chance to play with the concepts you've learned this summer. You will have two weeks to complete the project, so for this week all I'm asking for is a proposal post in the discussion forum telling us what you are thinking about doing.</p>
      <p>Also, as a heads-up: there will be a final exam the final week of class. It is completely based on the vocabulary. You will need to be able to identify the concepts through both words and given imagery. The more you practice using the vocab now, the better you will be prepared for the final exam. Don't start freaking out about the final yet, though, there will be study guides and prep tools coming next week. For this week, just focus on the design work.</p>
      <p>Have fun!!</p>
      <p><strong>design assignments and discussion forum posts are due by Thursday July 16</strong>
        <strong>final project is due by Thursday July 23</strong></p>
