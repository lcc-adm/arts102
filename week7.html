      <p>Hello all.</p>
      <p>We are almost at the end of the course. I hope you have enjoyed your creative summer. This is a reminder to please do a course evaluation. <a href="https://lcc.campuslabs.com/courseeval/" target="_blank">You can get to the evaluations here.</a> This lets both me and the school know how things went and what can be done to make the course even better in the future. Thanks in advance for your feedback.</p>
      <p>This week you have the whole week to finish your Self Directed Final Project! The project is worth 100 points. 50 points for the project and 50 points for the written analysis of your work. You will also need to post on the discussion board showing off your work to your classmates. Don't forget to comment on at least two other posts.</p>
      <p>It is also recommended that you look over the review sheet for the final exam, which will be available for the final week of class. I am sharing a number of resources below to help your prepare for the exam.</p>
      <p><strong>final project is due by Thursday July 23</strong></p>

      <h2>FINAL EXAM REVIEW</h2>
      <p>The final exam will be available next week. It is a departmental exam that everyone in ARTS 102 takes regardless of teacher or course delivery method. It is 70 questions, vocabulary-based, multiple-choice, open-book, and open-note. There is a two-hour limit for taking the exam so you won't have time to go in unprepared and expect to look up every answer. It is worth taking the time to review the course content before you take the test.</p>
      <p>Here are some resources to help you review:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>the ebooks from each unit have all the vocabulary and concepts</li>
        <li><a href="#">this list of vocab terms to understand</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://quizlet.com/_4bn93p" target="_blank">flashcards and video games at quizlet</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.cram.com/flashcards/arts-102-final-exam-vocab-review-9448733" target="_blank">flashcards and video games at cram</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.classtools.net/arcade/201801_BEGkk7" target="_blank">really bad (but useful) videogames at classtools.net</a></li>
        <li>kahoot! not sure how well this works for individual review, but they are quite fun in my face-to-face classes. to do this right, you will need two devices, one to run the games and one to use for playing the games. maybe you can get a friend to help? warning, there are some completely random silly zingers in the games to throw off the students.<ul>
