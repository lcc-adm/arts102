      <p>Welcome to another wonderful week of design.</p>
<p>Last week, we finished the first project. Please be sure to post your designs in the Discussion Forum for others to see. Take time to comment on other people's work. I hope you had fun working through the creative process of reading and vocab, leading to design concept sketches and explorations, followed by creating the final collages. We will be following the same process for the next two projects.</p>
<p>This week we start Project 2: a Propaganda Poster that advocates for something you feel passionate about. Like before, you will spend the first week learning the vocab and making design sketches. The second week will be spent creating the actual posters using whatever digital tools you choose to use.</p>
<p>I know some of you struggled with the process on the first project. It can be confusing and disorienting when the creative challenge is vague and when you can do just about anything you want to do. It can be difficult to work with loose rules and uncertain outcomes. I hope that working through the first project gave you a sense of the process. I'm available to answer any questions you have and to hold your hands through the process, if that helps. Please put me to use.</p>

      <p><strong>all of this week's assignments should be due by Sunday July 4. In recognition of the holiday, I'm moving the deadline to Tuesday July 6.</strong></p>

      <h2>readings</h2>
      <p>Start by reading about the design principles we'll be covering on this project. Similar to the introduction ebook, you don't need to read every word, but give these a good deep skim. Read deeper on anything that interests you.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="#">rhythm ebook</a></li>
        <li><a href="#">line ebook</a></li>
        <li><a href="#">shape ebook</a></li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="col-half-right white-box">
      <h2>vocab</h2>
      <p>Dig deeper into the concepts by exploring the vocabulary. You will need to write definitions and find representative imagery for the design principles. In addition to learning the ideas, you will be building your own study guides for the final exam at the end of the summer.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="#">rhythm vocab</a></li>
        <li><a href="#">line vocab</a></li>
        <li><a href="#">shape vocab</a></li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="col-half-left white-box">
      <h2>design exercises</h2>
      <p>Start creating art to explore the concepts. These activities are the preliminary design explorations you use to develop ideas for Project 2.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>design exercises</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="col-half-right white-box">
      <h2>community design activity</h2>
      <p>The weekly challenge to explore your creative world and share your discoveries with the class.</p>
      <ul>
      <li>week 4 community design challenge - marvelous mundane</li>
      <li>post your work on the discussion forum <em>(Communication tab)</em></li>
      </ul>
       </div>

       <div class="col-half-left white-box">
        <h2>survey</h2>
        <p>just a quick check-in. I want to know your perspective on how the class is going and what can be done to improve it. This isn't required and can be anonymous so feel free to be as open as you want to be. </p>
