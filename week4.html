      <p>If you can believe it, we are already about halfway through the course. I hope you have been enjoying your creative play so far. This week we are playing with two ideas you&#x2019;re probably already familiar with: shapes and lines. We are also starting the midterm project. Can you believe we are already at the midterm? Wow!</p>
      <p>Have fun and happy designing!</p>
      <p><strong>design assignments are due by Wednesday July 3</strong><br>
        <strong>midterm project is due by Thursday July 2</strong></p>

      <h2>SHAPE</h2>

      <p>Shapes are fun. Shapes are cool. Shapes are your friend. You know the standard geometric shapes like circles and squares, but those are boring. Shapes that don&#x2019;t have regular patterns or definitions are far more interesting to look at and explore. This week you get to play with squishy, curvy shapes that represent underwater creatures. So grab your swimsuit and snorkel and jump right in.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>read the <a href="#">Shape ebook</a></li>
        <li>review the <a href="#">Shape Assignment</a>, which includes technical instructions on getting started in Photoshop</li>
        <li>download the <a href="#">Shape Template</a> for Photoshop</li>
        <li>create your design work - have fun!</li>
        <li>save your work and post to the <a href="#">Shape Assignment dropbox</a>. don&#x2019;t forget to do the self-assessment writing</li>
        <li>post your work on the <a href="#">Shape Assignment discussion forum</a></li>
        <li>comment on at least two posts from your classmates</li>

      <h2>LINE</h2>

      <p>Lines are also pretty fun. They can be straight or curved or jagged or sketchy or clean or dotted or some combination of all of these. We start out as children drawing lines. Some people never progress beyond drawing lines. Even if you don&#x2019;t think you are a very good artist, you can probably rock a stick-figure, right? Sure you can. What else can you draw with simple lines?</p>
