      <p>For this week we will be exploring new design ideas and new Photoshop techniques. There is more room for creative play and visual exploration than last week. This is where you get to start opening up and playing with things that are more interesting than boring boxes and plain text. </p>
      <p>With Balance, the idea is to see how different pictorial elements can be organized in an overall composition. With Rhythm you will see how different patterns can capture different energies in a piece. You will be working in two very different ways this week and that is exciting.</p>
      <p>Have fun and happy designing!</p>
      <p><strong>all assignments are due by Thursday June 25</strong></p>

      <p>Balance is about balancing the different elements in a composition. We have three different compositional approaches we&#39;ll be exploring: Symmetry (mirror-line somewhere in the composition), Asymmetry (no mirror-line), and Radial Symmetry (arranged around a central point). Each of these approaches can create visual interest and convey different meanings. </p>
      <p>Adding complexity, you can also combine these approaches. For example a symmetrical arrangement of elements where the mirror-line is shifted away from center can become asymmetrical. Similarly, a radial arrangement of elements placed appropriately can also become symmetrical. I challenge you to explore those possibilities with your designs this week. </p>

      <h1>ASSIGNMENTS</h1>
      <p>Rhythm is usually associated with music and auditory patterns, but it also relates to visual patterns. Many of the same words are used to describe the different rhythms so my band-geek students should feel right at home. Patterns (and music) can be boring and repetitive, think of a checkerboard or striped wallpaper. Adding a bit of change or variety in the pattern can be more interesting to look at. For example, a zebra is really just alternating white and black stripes, but the shifting shapes in the pattern are far more interesting to look at than if the shapes were just flat and unchanging. </p>
      <p>The challenge for this assignment is not to capture repetition, that part is easy. The challenge is to find ways to make the patterns interesting and to capture a particular feeling, emotion, or sensation. How do you represent the feeling of happily flowing down a slow mellow river compared to the scary chaotic feeling of the planet exploding into a million pieces? The patterns for those will definitely look very different. </p>
