      <h2>ASSIGNMENT</h2>
      <p><em>Please read the <a href="#" target="_blank">Shape Ebook</a> before starting this assignment.</em></p>
      <p>Using the element of shape and the principles learned thus far in Design and Communications, you will create images that visually communicate through positive and negative shapes and visualize two of the following subjects:</p>
      <p><strong>Whale, shark, jellyfish, sea horse, octopus, manta ray.</strong></p>
      <p>While working on the assignment, you should focus on shape/contour control and creating images that represent the above characters while retaining a sense of figure/ground ambiguity or interplay. Keep your imagery as simple as possible. Use the edges of the picture plane whenever possible to help define shapes. You will be expected to create an interpretive image based on repetition of forms and repeating rhythms, positive and negative shape relationships. You may work black on white or white on black. No grays or gradients.</p>
      <p>You are required to have the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>2 subjects developed as four sketches and a final image on the second template provided.</li>
        <li>You must use rhythm in the image. Rhythm can be achieved by linear repetition and by repeated shapes.</li>
        <li>The image must be balanced, achieved by placement of the visual weights within the image.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Below are examples of digital sketches and a finished image for a shark and an octopus:</p>

      <h2>SOFTWARE TIPS</h2>
      <p>Hopefully by now you are feeling more comfortable with creating in Photoshop. The tools should start feeling more comfortable and familiar. We are not adding many new tools for this assignment.</p>
      <p>The following notes are a simple way to get started, however this isn&#x2019;t the only way to create your marks. A simple hard-edged paintbrush would work here. Remember to focus on <strong>shapes</strong> and not lines.</p>
      <p>For this project you will use the selection tools and the Edit commands. After creating your new file, make certain that your color palettes are set to default colors. (Black and White by pressing D). Create your 4 x 2 selection, fill with black (Edit &gt; Fill). Use the selection tools to &#x201C;cut out&#x201D; your shapes.</p>
      <figure><img src='default.gif' alt='help image' referrerPolicy='no-referrer' /></figure>
      <p>Make the selection in the black area, go Edit &gt; Cut, Edit &gt; Paste, and use the move tool to push the shape aside to be visual. Notice it creates a new layer. To change the orientation (angle) of the shape, go to Edit &gt; Transform &gt; Rotate. If you just want to flip the image over, Edit &gt; Transform &gt; Flip Horizontal (or Vertical).</p>

      <p>These instructions will help you get started on this assignment. Please refer to the Photoshop Resources page for more Photoshop help. You can always send me an email or ask for help on the discussion forum if you run into problems. </p>

    <div class='col-half-left'>
      <h2>SUBMITTING WORK</h2>
      <h3>ARTWORK</h3>
      <p>When finished with your designs, create a flattened .jpg file format. You can then upload the files in the <a href="#" target="_blank">Lesson 6 dropbox</a>. In total you will submit 2 image file for this assignment, along with your written self-assessment in D2L. For example, I would save my files as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>bennettc_seaCreatureName.jpg</li>
        <li>bennettc_seaCreatureName.jpg</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>ANALYSIS</h3>
      <p>Each week, you will be asked to respond to questions regarding your artwork created for each project. Please fill out the self-directed analysis, by answering the questions below when submitting your work in D2L.</p>
      <p><em>Hint: sometimes D2L gets twitchy so I recommend writing your answers in your favorite text editor (Word, Google Docs, etc.) and then copy/paste into the D2L comment box.</em></p>
      <p><strong>Self-Directed Analysis:</strong></p>
      <ol>
        <li>Explain which elements and principles of design are used to create plausible sea creature images, or an object of your choosing.</li>
        <li>Explain which principles of the Gestalt theory have been used and where they were used in your images.</li>
        <li>Do your images meet the project parameters? Please explain which specific type of shape is used to visually communicated each sea creature and why that type of<br>
          shape makes the most sense to use.</li>
        <li>What alternatives did you consider while doing this project?</li>
      </ol>
      <p><em>Hint: These are terms that should be used in your analysis: shape, positive shape, negative shape, rectilinear, curvilinear,figure/ground relationship.</em></p>

    <div class='col-half-right'>
      <h3>CRITIQUE</h3>
      <p>You will create a new post on the <a href="#" target="_blank">Lesson 6 Discussion Forum</a>. In this post you will upload the .jpg versions of your design and then tell us a little bit about what you created. You don&#x2019;t need to give the full formal breakdown that you wrote out in the analysis, however I would like you to use the vocab to explain what you were trying to do and if you think you were successful.</p>
      <p>As a way to continue your learning and appreciation of the concepts, you will read and respond to at least two of your classmate&#x2019;s posts. It helps to see how they responded to the same design prompts you were working with. Your critique may help them to see the ideas in a different light. Plus this is another chance for you to use the vocabulary in a slightly different context.</p>
      <p>At the very least, answer the following questions: Was the design successful in creating a graphic image that communicates the meaning of the concepts? How was this achieved? What is working particularly well in the design?</p>

      <h2>EVALUATION</h2>
      <p>The project is worth 20 points.</p>
      <p>The evaluation is based on:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>ORGANIZATION / FORMAT: Imagery is organized in a clear, appropriate and precise manner. Images are unified by repetition, rhythm, similarity, and/or continuity. 3 points.</li>
        <li>BALANCE: A correct interpretation of symmetrical, asymmetrical, and radial balance. Imagery engages the picture plane. 2 points.</li>
        <li>RHYTHM: Internal design dynamics support the intended imagery. Rhythm is present through repetition of lines, shapes, or negative space. 2 points.</li>
        <li>SHAPE: Images can be identified, have proper balance of positive and negative shapes, and can be interpreted as having some positive/negative space ambiguity. 10 points.</li>
        <li>SELF-DIRECTED ANALYSIS: A thoughtful evaluation of relevant issues correctly using the language of design. 3 points.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><em>Note the discussion forum posts and critiques are part of a separate assignment grade.</em></p>
