      <h2>OBJECTIVES</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>to use the principles of emphasis learned thus far to create images that visually communicate emphasis in a composition.</li>
        <li>to explore and utilize Unity, Gestalt, Repetition, Scale, and Emphasis within a composition.</li>
        <li>to continue to become familiar with Photoshop and its various tools.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>ASSIGNMENT</h2>
      <p><em>Please read the <a href='#'>Emphasis Ebook</a> before starting this assignment.</em></p>
      <p>Using the principles of Unity and Emphasis learned thus far in Design and Communications you will create images that use type and symbols as basic shapes to visually communicates a point of emphasis in each composition.You will create 6 compositions with a definite focal point that use type as a design element beyond its role as what it signifies for language, and to create balanced images with rhythmic properties. When working with the 6 concepts, try the use the following techniques, at least once, to create emphasis:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>isolation</li>
        <li>contrast</li>
        <li>placement</li>

      </ul>
      <p>Begin by making preliminary sketches for the 6 concepts in the area indicated on the template. Use the Type tool to create letter and number forms. Fill each template box with letterforms, numbers, and symbols that maintain consistency in terms of style. Use the same font only in each box. You may use different fonts in each image. Work with different font sizes in each image to work with differences of scale. You may also utilize pattern backgrounds (of type) and gradients. You may use black, white and grayscale only.</p>
      <p>Below are some ideas to keep in mind while working through the assignment:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Unity can be achieved by repetition, rhythm, similarity, or continuity.</li>
        <li>Repetition can be achieved by use of similar fonts, repeating shapes, and/or alternating values.</li>
        <li>Lack of Emphasis is created by reducing contrast and by repetitive or rhythmic placement - you want to avoid the lack of emphasis/or a focal point in your concepts.</li>

      </ul>
      <p>Below are examples of finished digital sketches:</p>

      <h2>SOFTWARE TIPS</h2>
      <p>Please note that these are only suggestions for your use, if you are familiar with the software and wish to use other tools, filters, gradients, etc. WITHIN THE PARAMETERS OF THE EXERCISE REQUIREMENTS, please feel free to do so. These tips are just to get you started or to help those still unfamiliar with the software.</p>
      <p>For Assignment 3, you will use the Type tool and Transform commands, and the Move tool again in the layers. Create your new file, select the Type tool, and in the Options palette (on top of your screen directly below the title bar) select your font (experiment, find one that gives you the shapes and proportions you like), select it&#39;s style,(Roman, Italic, etc.), and type in 150pt for size.</p>
      <figure><img src='TypeTool2.jpg' alt='type tools settings' referrerPolicy='no-referrer' /></figure>
      <p>Click in the image, and type one letter. Get the Move tool, and move the letter around your picture plane. Notice that it is a new layer with only the one letter on it. If you wish to turn the letter, go to Edit &gt; Transform &gt; Rotate. A small box will appear around your letter, and you can drag your mouse to rotate the letter at this time. When positioned at the angle you want, hit the Enter/Return key to set the transformation. You cannot go further until you either commit to the transformation or cancel it.</p>
      <figure><img src='transform.jpg' alt='photoshop interface showing transform menu' referrerPolicy='no-referrer' /></figure>
      <p>Repeat this for all the letters. Click on the correct layer to move them using the move tool, and with the layer active you can continue to rotate the letters individually using the above procedures. </p>

      <p>This video tutorial walks you through using Photoshop to complete this assignment: <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZw3bx4Dm9M' target='_blank' class='url'>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZw3bx4Dm9M</a></p>

      <p>These instructions will help you get started on this assignment. Please refer to the Photoshop Resources page for more Photoshop help. You can always send me an email or ask for help on the discussion forum if you run into problems. </p>

      <h2>SUBMITTING WORK</h2>
      <h3>ARTWORK</h3>
      <p>When finished with your design, create a flattened .jpg file format. You can then upload the file in the <a href='#'>Lesson 3 dropbox</a>. In total you will submit 1 image file for this assignment, along with your written self-assessment in D2L. For example, I would save my files as bennettc_emphasis.jpg and upload it to the Lesson 3 dropbox.</p>
      <h3>ANALYSIS</h3>
      <p>Each week, you will be asked to respond to questions regarding your artwork created for each project. Please fill out the self-directed analysis, by answering the questions below when submitting your work in D2L. </p>
      <p><em>Hint: sometimes D2L gets twitchy so I recommend writing your answers in your favorite text editor (Word, Google Docs, etc.) and then copy/paste into the D2L comment box.</em> </p>
      <p><strong>Self-Directed Analysis:</strong></p>
      <ol>
        <li>Explain how the element of unity and tehniques to create emphasis (contrast, placement, isolation) were used to create emphasis in the images.</li>
        <li>Explain which principles of the Gestalt theory have been used and where they were used in your concpets.</li>
        <li>Does the image meet the project objectives? Please explain how emphasis was created in each concept.</li>
        <li>What alternatives did you consider while doing this project?</li>
      </ol>

      <p><em>Hint: These are terms that should be used in your analysis: Emphasis/ focal point, accents, containment, gestalt, repetition, scale, grid(s), unity/harmony.</em></p>

    </div>

    <div class='col-half-right'>
      <h3>CRITIQUE</h3>
      <p>You will create a new post on the <a href='#'>Lesson 3 Discussion Forum</a>. In this post you will upload the .jpg version of your favorite design set and then tell us a little bit about what you created. You don&#39;t need to give the full formal breakdown that you wrote out in the analysis, however I would like you to use the vocab to explain what you were trying to do and if you think you were successful. </p>
      <p>As a way to continue your learning and appreciation of the concepts, you will read and respond to at least two of your classmate&#39;s posts. It helps to see how they responded to the same design prompts you were working with. Your critique may help them to see the ideas in a different light. Plus this is another chance for you to use the vocabulary in a slightly different context. </p>
      <p>At the very least, answer the following questions: Was the design successful in creating a graphic image that communicates the meaning of the word? How was this achieved? What is working particularly well in the design? </p>

      <h2>EVALUATION</h2>
      <p><strong>The project is worth 20 points.</strong> </p>
      <p>The evaluation is based on:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>ORGANIZATION / FORMAT:</strong> Imagery is organized in a clear, appropriate and precise manner. Images are unified by repetition, rhythm, similarity, and/or continuity. <strong>6 points</strong></li>
        <li><strong>EMPHASIS/FOCAL POINT:</strong> Imagery has a clearly defined focal point. An accent point supports the image. <strong>11 points</strong></li>
        <li><strong>SELF ASSESSMENT:</strong> Thoughtful evaluation of relevant issues correctly using the language of design. <strong>3 points</strong></li>

      </ul>

      <p><em>Note the discussion forum posts and critiques are part of a separate assignment grade.</em> </p>
