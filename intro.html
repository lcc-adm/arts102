      <p>Hello, my name is Chad Bennett. I am your instructor for ARTS 102. </p>
      <p>I'm an artist and designer. Iâ€™m just a guy who likes making stuff,
        mostly visual stuff. Teaching art and design has become my passion, I
        love helping students find their own artistic voices. I live in the
        country with my wonderful wife, two crazy kids, three kitties, a bunny,
        and a groundhog that lives under the shed. I enjoy eating tacos and
        ice-cream, but not at the same time.</p>
      <p>This course will familiarize you with an examination of visual
        communications theory, process and history. Students will study the
        universal elements and principles of two-dimensional design and their
        applications in monochromatic, still, and time-based media.</p>
