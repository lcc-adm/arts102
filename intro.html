      <p>Hello, my name is Chad Bennett. I am your instructor for ARTS 102.</p>
<p>I'm an artist and designer. Iâ€™m just a guy who likes making stuff, mostly visual stuff. Teaching art and design has become my passion, I love helping students find their own artistic voices. I live in the country with my wonderful wife, two crazy kids, three kitties, a bunny, and a groundhog that lives under the shed. I enjoy eating tacos and ice-cream, but not at the same time.</p>
<p>You can learn more about me at <a href="https://mister-chad.com/" target="_blank" title="opens in new tab">mister-chad.com</a>.</p>
