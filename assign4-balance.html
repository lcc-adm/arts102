      <h2>OBJECTIVES</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>to use the principle of Balance to create images that visually communicate balance in a composition.</li>
        <li>to explore and utilize Symmetrical, Asymmetrical, and Radial Balance within a composition.</li>
        <li>to continue to become familiar with the software Photoshop and it s various tools.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>ASSIGNMENT</h2>
      <p>Please read the <a href='#'>Balance Ebook</a> before starting this assignment.</p>
      <p>Using the principles of Unity, Emphasis, Rhythm, and Balance you will create images that use a chosen object to represent symmetrical, asymmetrical and radial balance within a composition. You are expected to create balanced compositions, that rely on the repetition of an image and are created without having a focal point.</p>
      <p>Begin by making preliminary sketches of your chosen object on the template. There are 3 rows on the template, one row should be 3 concepts that represent symmetrical balance. The next row, should be 3 concepts that represent asymmetrical balance. The last row, should be 3 concepts that represent radial balance. Once you have completed the template, you will then create 3 files that are 7 x 8 (vertical or horizontal orientations acceptable) at 72 ppi. Grayscale. Each file will represent one type of balance, (your favorite one from the template) so that you have 3 different compositions, representing 3 different types of balance (symmetrical, asymmetrical and radial). This is purely a design problem, but you must use representational forms. Feel free to be as creative as you wish, and to use other tools or options within the parameters of the exercise.</p>
      <p>Below are some ideas to keep in mind while working through the assignment:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>You must use Unity in the image. Unity can be achieved by repetition, rhythm, similarity, or continuity.</li>
        <li>You must use Rhythm in the image. Rhythm can be achieved by linear repetition and by repeated shapes.</li>
        <li>You must achieve Symmetrical, Asymmetrical, and Radial Balance in three separate images. Balance can be achieved by creating by balancing of the visual weights within the image.</li>
        <li>You must NOT have a focal point. Lack of Emphasis can be created by reducing contrast and by repetitive or rhythmic placement.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Below are examples of finished digital sketches:</p>

      <h2>SOFTWARE TIPS</h2>
      <p>If you do not like to draw and need to find a way to complete lesson 4 in a fast, effective manner that easily communicates balance in a visual manner, try this:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Locate the Custom Shape tool, which is hidden under the Rectangle tool (meaning you hold the mouse button down as you click on the Rectangle tool in the tool panel, to see what&#39;s hidden under it. The Custom Shape tool is the last tool available... looks like an odd flower shape.)</li>
        <li>Look at your context menu (the horizontal menu located at the top or your document window, right below the main menu). Next to the picture of the custom shape tool, in the context menu, there are 3 options of how you want to use the tool, select the 3rd one over.. if you hover over it with your mouse a yellow tool tip will pop up that reads &#39;fill pixels&#39;.</li>
        <li>Next continue looking to the right on the context menu to where the word shape is and there is a picture, with a drop down menu available. Choose a shape, any shape :) Also when you are looking at the shapes, you can click the little black arrow in the upper right hand corner, and select &quot;All&quot; from the drop down menu and when the dialog comes up asking you &quot;Replace current shapes with the shapes from All? Click Ok. (because it will really be ok!!)</li>
        <li>Again, pick a shape any shape. Move to your exercise template, (if you haven&#39;t made a new layer, make one now!!) and click and drag with your mouse to create the shape.</li>
        <li>You can move the shape around just as you would a square box...like in exercise 2... sound familiar?? - click on the move tool and move away.. if you want to resize the shape, while you have the move tool selected, click on &#39;Show Transforms Controls&quot; in the control panel and the transform controls will be visible around the shape, so you can resize as needed.</li>

      </ol>
      <p>A note on resizing.. whether you are making a shape bigger or smaller - if you hold down the shift key, while you drag a corner of the transform box, the shape will always retain it&#39;s original proportions. If your shape looks squished, one way or the other, to begin with, then just drag any of the points on the transform box to try to make it look like it has the correct proportions.</p>

      <h2>SUBMITTING WORK</h2>
      <h3>ARTWORK</h3>
      <p>When finished with your designs, create flattened .jpg file formats. You can then upload the files in the <a href='#'>Lesson 4 dropbox</a>. In total you will submit 4 image files for this assignment, along with your written self-assessment in D2L. For example, I would save my files as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>bennettc_balancetemplate.jpg</li>
        <li>bennettc_symmetrical.jpg</li>
        <li>bennettc_asymmetrical.jpg</li>
        <li>bennettc_radial.jpg</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>ANALYSIS</h3>
      <p>Each week, you will be asked to respond to questions regarding your artwork created for each project. Please fill out the self-directed analysis, by answering the questions below when submitting your work in D2L. </p>
      <p><em>Hint: sometimes D2L gets twitchy so I recommend writing your answers in your favorite text editor (Word, Google Docs, etc.) and then copy/paste into the D2L comment box.</em> </p>
      <p><strong>Self-Directed Analysis:</strong></p>
      <ol>
        <li>Explain how balance is achieved in each of the final images.</li>
        <li>Explain which principles of the Gestalt theory have been used and where they were used in your final images.</li>
        <li>Do your images meet the project parameters? Please explain how how symmetrical, asymmetrial and radial balance have been achieved.</li>
        <li>What alternatives did you consider while doing this project?</li>
      </ol>
      <p><em>Hint: These are terms that should be used in your analysis: symmetrical, asymmetrical, radial, rhythm, symbols, unity/harmony.</em></p>
    </div>

    <div class='col-half-right'>
      <h3>CRITIQUE</h3>
      <p>You will create a new post on the <a href='#'>Lesson 4 Discussion Forum</a>. In this post you will upload the .jpg version of your favorite design and then tell us a little bit about what you created. You don&#39;t need to give the full formal breakdown that you wrote out in the analysis, however I would like you to use the vocab to explain what you were trying to do and if you think you were successful. </p>
      <p>As a way to continue your learning and appreciation of the concepts, you will read and respond to at least two of your classmate&#39;s posts. It helps to see how they responded to the same design prompts you were working with. Your critique may help them to see the ideas in a different light. Plus this is another chance for you to use the vocabulary in a slightly different context. </p>
      <p>At the very least, answer the following questions: Was the design successful in creating a graphic image that communicates the meaning of the concepts? How was this achieved? What is working particularly well in the design? </p>

      <h2>EVALUATION</h2>
      <p>The project is worth 20 points. </p>
      <p>The evaluation is based on:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>ORGANIZATION / FORMAT: Imagery is organized in a clear, appropriate and precise manner. Images are unified by repetition, rhythm, similarity, and/or continuity. 3 points</li>
        <li>EMPHASIS: Imagery does not have a clearly defined focal point. 3 points</li>
        <li>BALANCE: A correct interpretation of symmetrical, asymmetrical, and radial balance. Imagery engages the picture plane. 11 points</li>
        <li>SELF-DIRECTED ANALYSIS: Thoughtful evaluation of relevant issues correctly using the language of design. 3 points</li>
      </ul>
      <p><em>Note the discussion forum posts and critiques are part of a separate assignment grade.</em> </p>
