      <p>Hello again and welcome to week 5. I hope you enjoyed the holiday
        weekend.</p>
      <p>Last week we spent time exploring Rhythm, Line, and Shape. You got a
        chance to read about the concepts and explore the vocabulary. You spent
        time doodling and sketching out how to implement those concepts into
        your propaganda poster.</p>
      <p>This week you are working to make the actual digital design. Use
        whatever design tools you have at your disposal. I have made some videos
        to help complete the project in Photoshop (and Photopea). You are not
        forced to use those tools, of course, so work with what you can.</p>
      <p>As you finish the poster, you will be reflecting on the work and
        posting the images for your classmates to see.</p>
      <p>As always, there is a weekly community design activity as well. I would
        like for you to go on a collection spree. Choose some topic or item and
        go collect a variety of images. More details are in the information
        page.</p>
      <p><strong>all of this week's assignments are due by Sunday July
          8.</strong></p>
