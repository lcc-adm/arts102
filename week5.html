      <p>We are starting this week a day early because of the holiday weekend. I want to give you a bit of extra time to work because I'm hoping you will spend some time celebrating with family and friends over the long weekend.</p>
      <p>There is only one design assignment this week because you are also completing your midterm projects. We are exploring how to create a sense of three-dimensional depth in a two-dimensional medium. There are plenty of techniques that can be used to trick your eyes into perceiving depth when it isn't really there. It can be difficult to achieve a real sense of depth, though, because we live in a 3d world and can tell when something is off. The assignment isn't difficult to start, but might take work to get perfect.</p>
      <p>We are finishing the propaganda posters this week.</p>
      <p>Have fun and happy designing!</p>
      <p><strong>design assignment is due by Thursday July 9</strong>

      <p>Creating a believable sense of depth is an interesting and challenging task. There are so many details that we use to perceive depth (that we usually take for granted). Shadows help place objects in space. Overlapping gives us visual cues for what object is closer than other objects. Start looking around and paying attention to how you see the world around you and how things fit into that world. It is a fun way to experience the world.</p>

      <p>We are completing the midterm project this week. I hope you have had some fun creating a visual to advocate for something you believe in. Make sure to be aware of details as you polish up your posters. The right color or texture or font choice can make a world of difference in how your poster is perceived. Show your poster around to get feedback to see how others react to it.</p>
