      <p>An important component to communication is the ability to function and communicate effectively within a group setting. It is most likely that we will all participate in a group activity at some point in our lives, whether it be in an educational, professional, or recreational setting. As a student you may be asked to work in a small group for a particular assignment. As a professional, you might have a job that allows you to function everyday as a member of a group, or if you play a sport, you may be a member of a team. </p>
      <p>It is important that the communication is clear and precise in all the above situations so that the groups/teams objective(s) can be met. As we continue throughout this chapter, we will learn more about the leadership and member roles that can be found within a group, so that we can participate effectively in a group setting.</p>
      <p>In visual communication, artists, graphic designers, web designers, photographers, animators, all work in groups, at times, to produce effective visual communications.</p>
      <p>While creating imagery, designers often work through a design process. A crucial part of the design process is the critique. Critique refers to a discussion that takes place at several times during the design process to help shape the final imagery that is being created. For example, if asked to design a logo, as part of a team, for a company, the designer will start with general ideas and get input from the team members. Based on that input, the designer will then continue to develop the design until it meets the groups standards. When the group has finished the logo the group will then present the logo to the client, in which the design can be accepted or it may be critiqued further and alterations made until it is an acceptable logo, in the client’s opinion.</p>
      <p>As a student in ARTS 102, Design and Visual Communication, you will be asked to participate in a critique for each project that is completed. Sometimes, you will be expected to critique in small groups and other times, the class will participate in the critique process as a whole.</p>
      <p>When finished with an exercise or a project in class, a student will present his/her project to the class, explain what he/she has done and how it has met the project requirements, then the critique process will begin. The rest of the class will be expected to engage in a discussion with the artist asking questions and offering suggestions, if possible, to improve upon the existing design. It is a process in which creative ideas are expressed and shared in a manner that can be beneficial to all. It is meant to be a positive exchange of information.</p>
      <p><strong>Critiquing is a verbal communication regarding a visual communication.</strong></p>

        <h2>What is a critique?</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Description:</strong> Gives an overview of things like medium, format, colors, proportions, relationship of elements, and number of elements. Does not evaluate, interpret, or lend conclusions.</li>
          <li><strong>Cause and Effect:</strong> Looking at the composition, analyzes choices made by artist or designer, and draws conclusions from those choices. Gives good indication of how the artist&#39;s or designer&#39;s communication is effective.</li>
          <li><strong>Compare and Contrast:</strong>Similarities and differences between two images are noted. Gives insight into different approaches to design problems.</li>
          <li><strong>Greatest Strength / Greatest Potential:</strong> Starts with an analysis of the design&#39;s strength, then expands with how the design can potentially be improved.</li>
        </ul>

      <section class="white-box padded">
        <h2>Why critique? </h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Improve the current design</li>
          <li>Generate ideas for next design</li>
          <li>Gain valuable design insights from others.</li>
          <li>Highly effective to developing design awareness</li>
        </ul>
        <p>During the critique process a discussion takes place that allows the visual artists to learn how to use design terminology properly to talk about the work at hand. Learning to talk about art and design intelligently will contribute to the success of one’s work when working in a professional environment. As an artist or designer, you will need to learn how to discuss your work and the work of others, as many creative types work on projects as a collaborative team. You will need to learn how to receive and give constructive criticism in order to be a valuable member to your team.</p>

        <h2>Definition of Small Groups</h2>
        <p>A small group generally consists of 3-12 people. The members of the group must be able to feel as if they can communicate openly and freely within the group so that the objectives of the group can be met.</p>
        <p>The group will develop norms about how to discuss things and the group will also develop roles which will influence the group dynamic. (a norm is a standard, model, or pattern regarded as typical, for example, when working in the group, every member will be on time).</p>
        <p>A group must have a common purpose or goal and be able to work through tension and conflict so that they can work together to reach their goal.</p>
        <p>As an artist of visual communication, you may work for a small design company or in a creative department of a larger company, in either situation you will be a member of a small group.</p>

        <h2>Leadership Styles in Small Groups</h2>
        <p>When discussion leadership styles within a small group,
          there are four main styles that we will discuss:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Autocratic</strong>: Leader uses his or her authority to make decisions.</li>
          <li><strong>Democratic</strong>: Authority is shared and all group members help make decisions.</li>
          <li><strong>Laissez-faire</strong>: &quot;hands-off&quot; style in which the leader allows the group to make its own decisions.</li>
          <li><strong>Abdacratic</strong>: No one in the group exercises leadership. This style, says researchers, leads to group disintegration and is followed by autocratic leadership. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>In visual communication, there is generally an art director that functions in the leadership role of the small group.</p>

        <h2>Roles in Small Groups</h2>
        <p>There are many roles that may or may not exist when working in a small group setting. Some classify roles in to 3 categories; Task-Oriented Roles, Social Roles and Individualistic Roles. Within these categories, there are many individual roles, which can all have a great effect on the overall effectiveness of the group.</p>

        <h2>Conflict in Small Groups and how to manage it</h2>
        <p>Conflict can be good for a group if it is managed appropriately. By airing differences, group members can produce quality decisions and satisfying interpersonal relationships. </p>

        <h2>Small Groups and the critique process</h2>
        <p>As discussed earlier, as a student in ARTS 102, Design and Visual Communication, you will be asked to participate in a many critiques, some of which will take place in the environment of a small group. At the end of the semester, you will be asked to write a reflective paper that summarizes your group experience and clearly examines your role and your teammates roles within the group.</p>
        <p>The principles learned as a result of this exercise will most definitely be found as you continue throughout your education as a student and enter the professional working world.</p>
