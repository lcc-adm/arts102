      <p>As a reminder, these weekly community design challenges are all about
        sharing ideas and explorations with each other. More importantly, they
        are about cultivating your own artistic sensibilities. They encourage
        you to be curious about the world around you and to look with fresh eyes
        at things that seem familiar.</p>
      <p>For this week's challenge, I would like you to document something that
        fascinates you. What are the little things about the world that you find
        neat; things that capture your attention and make you pause in your day.
        They can be things others find fascinating or could be things that
        everyone thinks you are weird for liking. It doesn't matter, no judgment
        here.</p>
      <p>Some things that I find fascinating: sunlight streaming through a
        window onto a wall or floor, weeds growing through a crack in the
        sidewalk or blacktop, worn wood (especially if there is paint peeling),
        the architecture of books stacked up in a jagged way, the little "hook"
        on top of soft-serve ice-cream cones. What about you?</p>
      <p>I would like for you to pick one topic or theme and take five pictures
        that capture your fascination. Spread this out, don't just take five
        shots of the same thing. Go explore and find multiple examples. This
        means you may have to go outside or even travel to different places.
        This means it might take more than one session playing with your camera.
        That's OK. The point is to go out and actually look at the world.</p>

      <h2>ASSIGNMENT SUBMISSION</h2>
      <p>To turn in your assignment, take your pictures and post them on <a
          href="#">the discussion forum</a> for everyone to see. Give us a short
        intro so we know what we are looking at.</p>
      <p>I'm not requiring anyone to post comments on each others work, but feel
        free to compliment and support each other. It is that sense of community
        that we're trying to build. Do what you can to participate in the
        community conversation.</p>

      <h2>ASSIGNMENT EVALUATION</h2>
      <p>I'm not going to grade these. I'm just going to enjoy them. I might
        give some feedback. Mostly, I just want you to make something. You get
        full points for making and sharing them.</p>
