      <h2>OBJECTIVES</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>to use the principles of perspective to construct boxes properly based on one point and two point perspective.</li>
        <li>to use the element of space and the principles of perspective to create a composition that visually communicate a sense of space and distance.</li>
        <li>to continue to become familiar with the software Photoshop and its various tools.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>ASSIGNMENT</h2>
      <p><em>Please read the <a href="#">Line Ebook</a> before starting this assignment.</em></p>
      <p>This Lesson has two design parts but no assessment:</p>
      <h3 class="atx" id="part-a">PART A</h3>
      <p>Create a file 400 pixels by 600 pixels at 72 pixels per inch. Create a Horizon Line near the horizontal center of the file.</p>
      <ol start="2">
        <li>
          <p>Place a Vanishing point near the center of the Horizon Line. Using that point as your reference, draw a box above the horizon in <strong>One Point Perspective</strong>.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Establish two new vanishing points near the outer edges of the file on the horizon line. In <strong>Two Point Perspective</strong>, draw a box below the horizon line.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>Boxes are required to show all 6 sides in each the 1pt. and 2pt. perspective drawings.</p>
      <h3 class="atx" id="part-b">PART B</h3>
      <p>Work out a composition of the Palm-lined street in at least 3 thumbnail sketches, Work at roughly the 5 x 7 scale. Submit only ONE sketch.</p>
      <p>Create a file 500 pixels by 700 pixels at 72 pixels per inch. Color mode should be grayscale. Create an image of a Palm Tree-lined Street receding into the distance using linear and aerial perspective and visual texture in One Point Perspective.</p>
      <p>As the trees get further from the viewer they should:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Get smaller. Use linear perspective to align locations for the trees.</li>
        <li>Fade in contrast. Use the concept of aerial perspective to soften the trees as they recede in space.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Use visual textures to simulate leaves, bark, etc. You may add any other elements you wish to embellish the composition, such as clouds, cars, etc., if you wish.</p>
      <p>Below are examples of digital sketches and a finished image for a shark and an octopus:</p>

      <figure><img src='palm2.jpg' alt='tree-lined street example' referrerPolicy='no-referrer' /></figure>
      <figure><img src='palm3.jpg' alt='tree-lined street example' referrerPolicy='no-referrer' /></figure>
    </div>

      <h2>SOFTWARE TIPS</h2>
      <p>For Lesson 8, you should be able to accomplish the task at hand using the selection tools, Fills and gradients, and the paintbrush tools. You may wish to make only one Palm tree: Edit>Copy, Edit>Paste, use the move tool to position it, Edit>Transform>Scale, to change sizes, Flip Horizontal for variety, and use the Magic Wand to select the tree on it's own layer and fill with the appropriate tone. Or you could just paint the whole thing as you go along. I recommend using layers to keep work separate. Keep in grayscale tones.</p>

      <p>These instructions will help you get started on this assignment. Please refer to the Photoshop Resources page for more Photoshop help. You can always send me an email or ask for help on the discussion forum if you run into problems. </p>

      <h2>SUBMITTING WORK</h2>
      <h3>ARTWORK</h3>
      <p>When finished with your designs, create flattened .jpg files. You can then upload the files in the <a href="#">Lesson 8 dropbox</a>. In total you will submit 3 image files for this assignment. For example, I would save my files as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>bennettc_boxes.jpg</li>
        <li>bennettc_perspective sketch.jpg</li>
        <li>bennettc_perspective final.jpg</li>
      </ul>


      <h3>ANALYSIS</h3>
      <p>There is no written analysis for this assignment. Put your energy into creating a believable sense of depth.</p>

    </div>

    <div class='col-half-right'>
      <h3>CRITIQUE</h3>
      <p>You will create a new post on the <a href="#">Lesson 8 Discussion Forum</a>. In this post you will upload the .jpg versions of your design and then tell us a little bit about what you created. I would like you to use the vocab to explain what you were trying to do and if you think you were successful.</p>
      <p>As a way to continue your learning and appreciation of the concepts, you will read and respond to at least two of your classmate's posts. It helps to see how they responded to the same design prompts you were working with. Your critique may help them to see the ideas in a different light. Plus this is another chance for you to use the vocabulary in a slightly different context.</p>
      <p>At the very least, answer the following questions: Was the design successful in creating a graphic image that communicates the meaning of the concepts? How was this achieved? What is working particularly well in the design?</p>

      <h2>EVALUATION</h2>
      <p>The project is worth 20 points.</p>
      <p>The evaluation is based on:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>EXERCISE 1 - Boxes in space are created correctly, with all 6 sides of each box (a 1pt. box and a 2pt. box) visible. 10pts.</li>
        <li>EXERCISE 2 - Palm trees are neatly clipped from the background and utilize principles of aerial and linear perspective properly. 10pts.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><em>Note the discussion forum posts and critiques are part of a separate assignment grade.</em></p>
