      <h2>OBJECTIVES</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>to use the principles of Unity learned thus far to create images that visually communicate the meaning of an assigned word.</li>
        <li>to begin to become familiar with the Photoshop software.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>ASSIGNMENT</h2>
      <p><em>Please read the <a href='#'>Unity Ebook</a> before starting this assignment.</em></p>
      <p>Using the design principle of <strong>Unity</strong>, you will create images that visually communicate the essence of the meaning of the following three words: <strong>Increase, Tension, and Order.</strong></p>
      <p><a href='#'>The template for this assignment can be found here.</a> </p>
      <p>You may only use 4 black squares, of the same size, in each big square to visually communicate the meaning the given word. Using only four squares is a seemingly limited palette to express such diverse words, yet these squares can be expanded into a more comprehensive language by utilizing various design principles.</p>
      <p>Begin by making six preliminary sketches for the words in the 6 smaller picture planes indicated on the template. Then select the most effective solution and copy and resize it in the larger picture plane on the bottom the template. </p>
      <p><strong>Please keep in mind the following:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>You may not distort your original squares and all squares in each individual picture plane must be the same size.</li>
        <li>Squares may extend beyond the picture plane to create more dynamic compositions.</li>

      </ul>
      <p>Below are examples of digital sketches and a finished image for each word. You are required to submit a file for each word that looks similar to the images below, with your own design solutions.</p>

      <h2>SOFTWARE TIPS</h2>
      <p>For this assignment you are just rearranging squares to fit the concept.</p>
      <p>On the template make a new layer (Layer &gt; New). Make sure this new layer is active, just click on it to make it active (you can view the layers in your designs by using the layer dialogue box, hit F7 if you do not have this visible.)</p>
      <p>Next create a square using the shape tool (right click on it in your toolbar, select rectangle tool and drag out the square). Make a copy of this layer by right clicking on the layer you just made and select Duplicate Layer. By selecting which layer is active you can move the squares independently.</p>
      <p>So now you just have to make 4 layers with 4 squares and move them around to fit the concept. You will end up having quite a few layers by the end of this assignment. </p>
      <p>While working, be sure to save often in the Photoshop .psd file format. Remember this is your working file that will keep layers intact. You will not be submitting this file, however you will want to save it in case you want to go back and edit in the future. </p>
      <p>To create a flattened file to submit go to File &gt; SaveAs and choose a .jpg version. In this file format you will lose all your layers and editing capabilities, however the file size will be considerably smaller and viewable on the internet.</p>

      <p>These instructions will help you get started on this assignment. Please refer to the Photoshop Resources page for more Photoshop help. You can always send me an email or ask for help on the discussion forum if you run into problems. </p>

      <h2>SUBMITTING WORK</h2>
      <h3>ARTWORK</h3>
      <p>When finished with your design, create a flattened .jpg file format. You can then upload the file in the <a href='#'>Lesson 2 dropbox</a>. In total you will submit 3 image files for this assignment: a file for Increase, a file for Order and a file for Tension, along with your written self-assessment in D2L. For example, I would save my files as: bennettc_increase.jpg, bennettc_order.jpg, and bennettc_order.jpg and upload them to the Lesson 2 dropbox.</p>
      <h3>ANALYSIS</h3>
      <p>Each week, you will be asked to respond to questions regarding your artwork created for each project. Please fill out the self-directed analysis, by answering the questions below when submitting your work in D2L. </p>
      <p><em>Hint: sometimes D2L gets twitchy so I recommend writing your answers in your favorite text editor (Word, Google Docs, etc.) and then copy/paste into the D2L comment box.</em> </p>
      <p><strong>Self-Directed Analysis:</strong></p>
      <ol>
        <li>Explain how your exercise images are unified.</li>
        <li>Explain which principles of the Gestalt theory have been used and where they were used in your images.</li>
        <li>Do your images meet the project parameters? Please explain how the meaning of the words (increase, order and tension) are visually communicated?</li>
        <li>What alternatives did you consider while doing this project?</li>
      </ol>
      <p><em>Hint: These are terms that should be used in your analysis: Containment, gestalt, repetition, grid(s), unity/harmony.</em></p>

      <h3>CRITIQUE</h3>
      <p>You will create a new post on the <a href='#'>Lesson 2 Discussion Forum</a>. In this post you will upload the .jpg version of your favorite design set and then tell us a little bit about what you created. You don&#39;t need to give the full formal breakdown that you wrote out in the analysis, however I would like you to use the vocab to explain what you were trying to do and if you think you were successful. </p>
      <p>As a way to continue your learning and appreciation of the concepts, you will read and respond to at least two of your classmate&#39;s posts. It helps to see how they responded to the same design prompts you were working with. Your critique may help them to see the ideas in a different light. Plus this is another chance for you to use the vocabulary in a slightly different context. </p>
      <p>At the very least, answer the following questions: Was the design successful in creating a graphic image that communicates the meaning of the word? How was this achieved? What is working particularly well in the design? </p>

      <h2>EVALUATION</h2>
      <p><strong>The project is worth 20 points.</strong> </p>
      <p>The evaluation is based on:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>ORGANIZATION / FORMAT:</strong> Imagery is organized in a clear, appropriate and precise manner. Shapes are unified by repetition, rhythm, similarity, and/or continuity. <strong>15 points</strong></li>
        <li><strong>SELF ASSESSMENT:</strong> Thoughtful evaluation of relevant issues correctly using the language of design. <strong>5 points</strong></li>

      </ul>
      <p><em>Note the discussion forum posts and critiques are part of a separate assignment grade.</em> </p>
