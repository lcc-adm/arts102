      <p>As an LCC student, you have a Google Drive account for storing your files. You will create
        a folder in your Drive and share with me. This is where you will be turning in your
        assignments.</p>
      <p>I will walk you through this process in class, however the instructions are also provided
        here.</p>
      <h2>SHARED GOOGLE FOLDER SETUP</h2>
      <p>As an LCC student, you have a Google Drive account for storing your files. You will create
        a folder in your Drive and share with me.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Login to the <a href='https://my.lcc.edu' target="_blank"
            title="opens in new tab">my.lcc.edu</a> portal.</li>
        <li>In the upper-right corner of your main page click the link to student email.</li>
        <li>In the upper-right corner of your email, click the 3x3 grid box and select Drive. This
          is your digital storage account.</li>
        <li>Press the big NEW icon in the upper left and select Folder. Name your folder
          <strong>lastname first name</strong>.</li>
        <li>Right-click on the new folder and choose to <strong>Share…</strong> your folder with me
          at <strong>bennetc7@star.lcc.edu</strong></li>
        <li>Please make sure you are giving me permission to <strong>Edit</strong> that folder.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>NOTES</h2>
      <p>This setup will only give me access to the content of one particular folder. I can’t see
        anything else in your google drive. This is a good thing. Please remember to turn in all
        assignments to this folder.</p>
      <p>I will create a <strong>Graded</strong> folder within our shared folder. When I am done
        grading an assignment, it will get moved into the Graded folder. That lets me easily know
        what assignments need to be graded/regraded.</p>
