      <p>Hello and welcome to the Summer 2021 online version of ARTS 102.</p>
      <p>Since this is summer, the course is quite accelerated. You will be
        completing a full-semester's worth of work in only two months. Each week
        there will be several activities to complete. Some will be quick and
        easy, others will take a bit of time. I recommend figuring out the tasks
        early and spreading them out over the week. Don't try to get everything
        done in one sitting.</p>
      <p>This first week is all about getting the systems figured out,
        introducing you to the ebooks, and starting to play around with
        Photoshop. It may seem like there is a lot here, but that's only because
        it is spread out. Some of these tasks will not take very long to
        complete. There will be fewer (although deeper) tasks in future weeks.
      </p>
      <p>Not all assignments for this week are graded, but they are required.
      </p>
      <p><strong>all assignments are due by Sunday June 13.</strong></p>

      <h2>website exploration activities</h2>
      <p>Since this course is completely online, it makes sense to learn how to
        get around the site. These tasks introduce you to some of the things you
        will be doing throughout the rest of the course.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>check out the syllabus, schedule, and other items in the
          <strong>Important Class Stuff</strong> section. If you have any
          questions, please ask them in the email that you will be sending me in
          the next task.</li>
        <li>send me an email using the D2L email system <em>(Communication
            tab)</em>. In this email include your full name, your level of
          familiarity with Photoshop and Desire2learn, and just a little about
          yourself and why you are taking this class.</li>
        <li>introduce yourself on the Discussion forum <em>(Communication
            tab)</em>. Further details are provided in the actual discussion
          forum.</li>

      <h2>introduction of design concepts</h2>
      <p>This ebook is a quick overall introduction to the concepts we will be
        covering over the course of the class. Think of this as the teaser
        trailer for an awesome upcoming television series.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>read the <a href="#">Introduction</a> ebook. You don't need to read
          every single word, but give it a good deep skim.</li>
      </ol>

    <div class="col-half-left white-box">

      <h2>art stuff</h2>
      <p>We will be (most likely) using Adobe Photoshop to create visual
        explorations based on different design concepts. You are able to choose
        what design tools you would like to use though, so don't feel like you
        <em>have</em> to use Photoshop. This isn't a software class and you
        probably won't be making art worth hanging on a gallery wall, however
        you will need to learn enough of the tools to get around and complete
        your work. The plan this week is to find your software and just tinker
        around.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>get a copy of Photoshop (or other program) for yourself.
          [[photoshop|Check here to get more information about how to acquire
          Photoshop and how to use the tools.]]</li>
        <li>make a [[assign1 self-portrait|self-portrait picture in whatever
          digital tools you choose.]]</li>
        <li>turn your picture in to the assignment dropbox <em>(Assessments tab
            &gt; Assignments &gt; Assignment 1)</em></li>
      </ol>

      <h2>community design activity</h2>
      <p>It is notoriously difficult to create a sense of community in online
        classes. It is hard to hang out and share ideas when you aren't meeting
        together in the same physical location. This is unfortunate because art
        classes are especially wonderful places for creative community. Students
        can learn just as much from fellow artists as they can from the teacher.
      </p>
      <p>I'm determined to find a fun way for everyone to become creative
        friends this summer. Each week you will have a design activity that you
        will share with the class. These assignments are meant to be fun and
        playful and not at all serious. They are meant to be hands-on
        explorations of creative play.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>[[community design challenge - make a zine|make a zine]].</li>
        <li>post your work on the Discussion forum <em>(Communication tab)</em>.
        </li>
