      <p>Hello and welcome to the Summer 2020 online version of ARTS 102. </p>
      <p>Since this is summer, the course is quite accelerated. You will be completing a full-semester&#39;s worth of work in only two months. Each week there will be several activities to complete. Some will be quick and easy, others will take a bit of time. I recommend figuring out the tasks early and spreading them out over the week. Don&#39;t try to get everything done in one sitting.</p>
      <p>This first week is all about getting the systems figured out, introducing you to the ebooks, and starting to play around with Photoshop. It may seem like there is a lot here, but that&#39;s only because it is spread out. Some of these tasks will not take very long to complete. There will be fewer (although deeper) tasks in future weeks. </p>
      <p>The assignments for this week are NOT graded, but they are required.Â </p>
      <p><strong>all assignments are due by Thursday June 11.</strong></p>

      <h2>website exploration activities</h2>
      <p>Since this course is completely online, it makes sense to learn how to get around the site. These tasks introduce you to some of the things you will be doing throughout the rest of the course. </p>
      <ol class="custom-counter">
        <li>check out the syllabus, schedule, and other items in the <strong>Important Class Stuff</strong> section. If you have any questions, please ask them in the email that you will be sending me in the next task. </li>
        <li>send me an email using the D2L email system <em>(Communication tab)</em>. In this email include your full name, your level of familiarity with Photoshop and Desire2learn, and just a little about yourself and why you are taking this class.</li>
        <li>introduce yourself on the Discussion forum <em>(Communication tab)</em>. Further details are provided in the actual discussion forum. </li>

      <h2>introduction of design concepts</h2>
      <p>This ebook is a quick overall introduction to the concepts we will be covering over the course of the class. Think of this as the teaser trailer for an awesome upcoming television series.</p>
      <ol class="custom-counter">
        <li>read the <a href='#'>Introduction</a> ebook</li>

      <h2>communication model</h2>
      <p>ARTS 102 is the foundation for all ARTS classes. It can also count as an alternative to a traditional Speech class. You will be learning about design concepts this semester, however we also discuss the formal process by which communication happens. For this section, you will read a few ebooks and take a short quiz. </p>
      <ol class="custom-counter">
        <li><a href='#'>Communication Model ebook</a></li>
        <li><a href='#'>Group Work ebook</a></li>

      <h1>assignments</h1>
      <h2>photoshop stuff</h2>
      <p>We will be using Adobe Photoshop to create visual explorations based on different design concepts. This isn't a software class and you probably won't be making art worth hanging on a gallery wall, however you will need to learn enough of the tools to get around and complete your work. The plan this week is to get a copy of Photoshop and just tinker around. </p>
      <ol class="custom-counter">
        <li>get a copy of Photoshop for yourself. <a href='#'>Check here to get more information about how to acquire Photoshop and how to use the tools.</a></li>
        <li>make a <a href='#'>self portrait picture in Photoshop</a></li>
        <li>turn your picture in to the assignment dropbox <em>(Assessments tab &gt; Assignments &gt; Assignment 1)</em></li>
      </ol>
