      <p>As a reminder, these weekly community design challenges are all about sharing ideas and explorations with each other. More importantly, they are about cultivating your own artistic sensibilities. They encourage you to be curious about the world around you and to look with fresh eyes at things that seem familiar.</p>
<p>An important part of being an artist is connecting with your world, connecting with the muse, connecting with your curiosity. As artists, we deal directly with true experience and capture our adventures in some sort of tangible form to share with others. Our recorded experiences communicate the adventure and can take on the form of paintings, music, sketches, drawings, doodles, patterns, rhythms, dance, film, animation, etc. The experiences themselves can be physical adventures, emotional explorations, conceptual play, etc. Often times, the artistic experiential journey is one that delves into the unknown. It is an act of personal discovery.</p>
<p>Your assignment for this artist’s date is to <strong>find beauty in the marvelous mundane</strong>.</p>
<p>As busy people running around living our lives, we find that familiarity breeds invisibility. You stop noticing the things that live in your world, whether it is the tools you use, the decorations in your house, that mess in the corner you still haven't picked up, those people you live with, the scenery on the way to work. You get so used to those things being there that you stop looking at them or appreciating their fine details.</p>
<p>Mostly, you only notice these thing when they are missing or have moved from their normal spot. That's why it is so much fun to rearrange your living room or bedroom. The same stuff in a new configuration makes you see things in a new way.</p>
<p>This week, I don't want you to necessarily rearrange your world, however I would like you to take a look around with fresh eyes to see the beauty that has been there all along. <strong>Take five pictures of things or spaces or even people that you have taken for granted for far too long.</strong> Things that are chipped or worn or even broken can be beautiful. Things you bought or collected because you once thought the were neat, but have forgotten about even though they lay around in plain sight. Things that have become utilitarian and functional despite being really cool to look at.</p>
<p>Through your images, try to give your subjects the honor and gratitude they deserve. Use composition and placement, emphasize details that are important. Try to show the beauty that you see in them.</p>

            <p>When I was six or seven years old, growing up in Pittsburgh, I used to take a precious penny of my own and hide it for someone else to find. It was a curious compulsion; sadly, I’ve never been seized by it since. For some reason, I always “hid” the penny along the same stretch of sidewalk up the street. I would cradle it at the roots of a sycamore, say, or in a hole left by a chipped-off piece of sidewalk. Then I would take a piece of chalk, and, starting at either end of the block, draw huge arrows leading up to the penny from both directions.</p>
            <p>
            After I learned to write I labeled the arrows: SURPRISE AHEAD or MONEY THIS WAY. I was greatly excited, during all this arrow-drawing, at the thought of the first lucky passer-by who would receive in this way, regardless of merit, a free gift from the universe. But I never lurked about. I would go straight home and not give the matter another thought, until, some months later, I would be gripped again by the impulse to hide another penny.</p>
            <p>
            The world is fairly studded and strewn with pennies cast broadside from a generous hand. But — and this is the point — who gets excited by a mere penny?
            It is dire poverty indeed when a man is so malnourished and fatigued that he won’t stoop to pick up a penny. But if you cultivate a healthy poverty and simplicity, so that finding a penny will literally make your day, then, since the world is in fact planted in pennies, you have with your poverty bought a lifetime of days.</p>
            <p>
            It is that simple.</p>
            <p>— Annie Dillard</p>

      <h2>NOTES</h2>
      <p>If your parents or significant others ask why you are going out to
        play, tell them it is for homework. If they don't believe you, show them
        this assignment page as proof.</p>
      <p><strong>Obligatory Warning:</strong> this in no way gives you
        permission to go do something illegal, immoral, or potentially dangerous
        for your assignment. Please do not get arrested or sent to the hospital
        because you are doing something stupid.</p>

      <h2>ASSIGNMENT SUBMISSION</h2>
      <p>To turn in your assignment, you will simply write a post on <a
          href="#">the discussion forum</a> <em>(Communication tab)</em> telling
        us what you did and how it went. It would be great if you have some
        tangible, visual documentation to share. It could be a photo or a
        drawing or even a visual poem. Let the experience inspire you.</p>
      <p>I'm not requiring anyone to post comments on each others work, but feel
        free to compliment and support each other. It is that sense of community
        that we're trying to build. Do what you can to participate in the
        community conversation.</p>

      <h2>ASSIGNMENT EVALUATION</h2>
      <p>I'm not going to grade these. I'm just going to enjoy them. I might
        give some feedback. Mostly, I just want you to make something. You get
        full points for making and sharing them.</p>
