      <p><strong>You will be creating two digital collages exploring the design
          principles of Unity, Emphasis, and Balance.</strong></p>
      <p>Content, style, tools, and artistic statement are the artist's choice.
        You get the freedom to make what you want and say what you want to say.

      <h2>principles &amp; elements</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="col-single-left white-box">
      <h3>unity</h3>
      <p>The principle of Unity is about finding common themes, whether visual
        or conceptual. Each element of the collage will help contribute to
        building the overall whole.</p>
      <p><strong>Collage 1 should explore visual unity through objects that have
          similar visual characteristics</strong>. It doesn't matter what the
        objects actually are, they just need to look the same. For example,
        things that are red could be stop signs, Coke cans, buckets of blood,
        Santa hats, taillights, candy canes, etc. These are all red, but are
        very different objects. You still want contrast, so don't make every
        single element red. Use other colors as a complement, such as a green
        field with red flowers (made up of candy canes and Santa hats, of
        course).</p>
      <p><strong>Collage 2 should explore conceptual unity through objects that
          have similar ideas, things that are the same no matter what they look
          like</strong>. For example, a collection of vehicles could be things
        like cars, boats, airplanes, skateboards, pogo-sticks, rocketships, etc.
        These all look very different, but are all things that can take you to
        new places.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-single-mid white-box">
      <h3>emphasis</h3>
      <p>While Unity is about bringing things together, the principle of
        Emphasis is about making individual elements stand out. The essential
        trick is to establish a visual pattern and then break that pattern. For
        example, a bunch of small, round, and flowing objects contrasted by one
        big, square, jagged element.</p>
      <p><strong>Both collages should have one element or grouping that acts as
          a clear focal point of the composition</strong>. Other elements in the
        composition should act as accents that point the viewer's eye toward
        that focal point. Note that Radial symmetry can create immediate focal
        points because there's an obvious central point to the pattern.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-single-right white-box">
      <h3>balance</h3>
      <p>The principle of Balance is about making sure all the elements in the
        composition feel arranged and positioned in just the right way.
        Sometimes a composition wants to feel energetic, as if the elements are
        dynamically moving. Other times, a composition wants to feel relaxed and
        static, as if the elements are completely at rest and happy right where
        they are. We can use Symmetry and Asymmetry as tricks to balance the
        compositions.</p>
      <p><strong>You should have one collage that is Symmetric (clear line of
          reflection) and one collage that is Asymmetric (no clear line of
          reflection)</strong>. A symmetric reflection does not need to be
        placed exactly horizontally or vertically and does not need to be in the
        center of the page. Similarly, an asymmetric design could include
        smaller elements that are symmetric. It is all about placement of
        elements in the overall composition.</p>
    </div>


    <div class="col-full outline" style="column-count: 2; column-gap: 2rem;">
      <h2>artistic statement</h2>
      <p>Choosing elements and arranging them according to the design principles
        is only part of the project. You also need to consider what are you
        saying and how are you saying it. Randomly scattering your elements
        across the page just to fill the space is the boring first response many
        new designers have. <strong>Please don't do this.</strong></p>
      <p>Instead, take the time to think about how you can arrange those
        elements into patterns or bigger groupings. Can you create recognizable
        shapes out of those groupings? For example, those vehicles listed above
        can be grouped into giant robots having a battle. The cars and boats and
        pogo-sticks become arms and legs of the robots. Or all those red
        elements could become birds lined up on a tree branch.</p>
      <p>Finally, consider what visual story you are telling with your designs.
        Is the robot battle a fair fight? Is there one big robot fighting a
        bunch of smaller robots or is it two equally matched bots? Is one side
        clearly winning or are they just about to fight in one of those epic
        stand-off scenes you always see on movie posters? Is there are good side
        we should be a rooting for?</p>
      <p>Of course, your stories do not need to be that complex or detailed.
        Maybe your red birds are just happy to be sitting on that tree branch.
        If so, how can you let us know it is a comfortable and wonderful day to
        be a bird? Or maybe it is a dark day because a fellow bird-friend is
        missing? How would you show that?</p>
      <p>You are not obligated to make recognizable objects or tell specific
        stories with characters. Maybe you want to create a line of elements
        flowing around the page. Does the line feel like it moves quickly or
        slowly? Are there gaps in it? Does it curve a lot or is it move in
        straight lines? Are there two lines interacting, intersecting, breaking
        into each other? What is the background like and how does it contrast
        with the elements? Does it feel happy or sad or scary?</p>
      <p>Basically, the point here is to <strong>do something intentional and
          meaningful</strong> with your collages. Be aware of how your elements
        interact with each other. Where are there harmonies and where are there
        tensions? How can you control that to make an interesting image that is
        more than just random elements on the page?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="col-double-left">
      <h2>process</h2>
      <p>The desire is to have a beautiful final image, however, the point of
        this project is to follow the creative process and explore the design
        principles. Working through the steps makes it much more likely a
        quality finished image will result. Many newbies will jump blindly into
        an idea and rush straight to making something without really considering
        the possibilities. This can sometimes work, but rarely can it be relied
        on to be successful.</p>
      <p>The most important part of the process is to get your ideas out of your
        head and into a tangible form. Write things down, sketch them out, make
        doodles, scribble, make lists, etc. The format doesnâ€™t matter, just do
        whatever makes sense to you. The focus is on the ideas, not the quality
        of the marks. A bunch of scribbles and arrows can be critically
        important if they are meaningful to you.</p>

      <h2>practical stuff</h2>
      <p>Here are the basics:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Size:</strong> a rectangular image not larger than
          8&quot;x10&quot; so that it could be printed on a letter-sheet of
          paper. Adjust proportions as appropriate for the art. A tall, skinny
          design can be just as good as a square composition.</li>
        <li><strong>Resolution:</strong> 300 ppi/dpi.</li>
        <li><strong>Digital Software:</strong> instructions will be given for
          using Photoshop, however it is not required. Any digital art software
          you choose to use should be fine.</li>
        <li><strong>Files:</strong> master layered files and flattened image
          files.</li>
      </ul>
