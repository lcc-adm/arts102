      <h2>OBJECTIVES</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>to use the element of color to create images that visually communicate a color scheme and a pattern in a visual composition.</li>
        <li>to explore and utilize color schemes to create variations of the same design.</li>
        <li>to explore and utilize repetition and rhythm, balance and unity within a composition.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>ASSIGNMENT</h2>
      <p><em>Please read the <a href="#" target="_blank">Color Ebook 1</a> &amp; <a href="#" target="_blank">Color Ebook 2</a> before starting this assignment.</em></p>
      <p>Using the element of color and the principles learned thus far in Design and Communication, you will create an image design based on the <strong>Gee’s Bend Collective</strong> work, or on the <strong>traditional West African textiles called Kente cloth</strong> that seem to be an integral part of this tradition. The design will lay out the shapes to be used in 3 successive images, all in a different color scheme.</p>
      <p>Focus on a theme. Sketch options and different compositions. Gather visual resources, and review the assigned readings. Play with ﬁlters for interesting textures. You may add background textures, either from other textiles or other sources. Unify your image by using grids, rhythm and repetition, aligning edges, being aware of your picture plane, overall surface textures, consistent fonts (if used). Is there a focal point? If not, why not? How are you balancing the image, to what effect, and why?</p>
      <p>To start, create a new file that is 7” x 9”, either horizontal or vertical, at 140 pixels per inch, then, based on research and inspiration, get creative. You will need to begin by selecting a color scheme - analogous, monochromatic, complementary.</p>
      <p>Requirements for the image will include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>the use of repetition in the image, the use of rhythms in the image,</li>
        <li>3 completed images, deﬁning a speciﬁc color scheme within each image.</li>
        <li>Proper tone and color selection for images.</li>
        <li>Consistency of shapes and imagery within the composition.</li>
        <li>You must have a balanced image. Symmetric is static; Asymmetric creates movement.</li>
        <li>Images stylistically represent the researched materials.</li>
        <li>Images stylistically represent the researched materials.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Your work might look something like this (but, by no means, should it look exactly like this):</p>

      <h2>REFERENCE INFORMATION</h2>

      <p>From Wikipedia…The Quilts of Gee's Bend are quilts created by a group of women and their ancestors who live or have lived in the isolated  African-American hamlet of Gee's Bend, Alabama along the Alabama River. The Quilts of Gee's Bend are considered to be unique, and one of the most important  African-American visual and cultural contributions to the history of art within the United States.</p>
      <p>Just southeast of Selma, in the  Black Belt  of  Alabama, Gee's Bend (ofﬁcially called  Boykin) is an isolated, rural community of about seven hundred inhabitants. The area is named after Joseph Gee, a landowner who came from  North Carolina and established a cotton plantation in 1816 with his seventeen slaves. In 1845 the plantation was sold to Mark H. Pettway, this name still remains predominant in the county as many members of the community still carry the name. After emancipation many freed slaves stayed on the plantation as  sharecroppers.</p>
      <h3>The Quilts</h3>
      <p>The quilting tradition in Gee's Bend goes back to the 19th century. Perhaps inﬂuenced in part by patterned  African textiles, female slaves pieced together strips of cloth to make bedcovers. Throughout the post-bellum years and into the 20th century, Gee's Bend women made quilts to keep themselves and their children warm. Along the way they developed a distinctive style, noted for its lively improvisations and geometric simplicity.</p>
      <p>The quilts have been exhibited at the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, the  Indianapolis Museum of Art, the  Philadelphia Museum of Art, and the  Whitney Museum of American Art, among others. The reception of the work has been mostly positive, as Alvia Wardlaw, curator of Modern and Contemporary Art at the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston  wrote, "The compositions of these quilts contrast dramatically with the ordered regularity associated with many styles of Euro-American quiltmaking. There's a brilliant, improvisational range of approaches to composition that is more often associated with the inventiveness and power of the leading 20th-century abstract painters than it is with textile-making”.</p>
      <p> The Whitney venue, in particular, brought a great deal of art-world attention to the work, starting with Michael Kimmelman's review in The New York Times  which called the quilts 'some of the most miraculous works of modern art American has produced' and went on to describe them as a version of Matisse and Klee arising in the rural South. More than 50 quiltmakers currently make up the Gee's Bend Collective., which is owned and operated by the women of Gee’s Bend. Every quilt sold by the Gee’s Bend Quilt Collective is unique and individually produced.”</p>

      <h3>Kente Cloth</h3>
      <p>Kente was probably introduced from the western Sudan during the 16th century, when heavy, elaborate, labor-intensive versions of this fabric were designed for wealthy tribal chiefs and simpler designs became available for the general citizenry. Kente is woven in four-inch (9.5 cm) narrow strips that are sewn together. A characteristic Asante kente has geometric shapes woven in bright colors along the entire length of the strip, while Ewe kente often displays a tweed effect by plying together different colored threads in many of the warps. Ewe kente may also incorporate pictorial symbols.</p>

      <h2>SUBMITTING WORK</h2>
      <h3>ARTWORK</h3>
      <p>When finished with your designs, create flattened .jpg files. You can then upload the files in the <a href="#" target="_blank">Lesson 10 dropbox</a>. In total you will submit 3 image files for this assignment. For example, I would save my files as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>bennettc_analogous.jpg</li>
        <li>bennettc_monochrome.jpg</li>
        <li>bennettc_complementary.jpg</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>ANALYSIS</h3>
      <p>Each week, you will be asked to respond to questions regarding your artwork created for each project. Please fill out the self-directed analysis, by answering the questions below when submitting your work in D2L.</p>
      <p><em>Hint: sometimes D2L gets twitchy so I recommend writing your answers in your favorite text editor (Word, Google Docs, etc.) and then copy/paste into the D2L comment box.</em></p>
      <p><strong>Self-Directed Analysis:</strong></p>
      <ol>
        <li>Explain why you chose to focus on the quilts or Kente cloths for this exercise and what inspired you.</li>
        <li>Explain how each design is balanced and unified.</li>
        <li>Explain how each of the 3 color schemes were created and which you like best, and why.</li>
        <li>What alternatives did you consider while doing this project?</li>
      </ol>
      <p><em>Hint: These are terms that should be used in your analysis: value, high-key, low-key</em></p>
    </div>

    <div class='col-half-right'>
      <h3>CRITIQUE</h3>
      <p>You will create a new post on the <a href="#" target="_blank">Lesson 10 Discussion Forum</a>. In this post you will upload the .jpg versions of your design and then tell us a little bit about what you created. I would like you to use the vocab to explain what you were trying to do and if you think you were successful.</p>
      <p>As a way to continue your learning and appreciation of the concepts, you will read and respond to at least two of your classmate's posts. It helps to see how they responded to the same design prompts you were working with. Your critique may help them to see the ideas in a different light. Plus this is another chance for you to use the vocabulary in a slightly different context.</p>
      <p>At the very least, answer the following questions: Was the design successful in creating a graphic image that communicates the meaning of the concepts? How was this achieved? What is working particularly well in the design?</p>
