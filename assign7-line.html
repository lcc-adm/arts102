      <h2>OBJECTIVES</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>to use the element of line to create images that visually communicate line in a composition.</li>
        <li>to explore and utilize repetition, balance and unity within a composition.</li>
        <li>to continue to become familiar with the software Photoshop and it s various tools.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>ASSIGNMENT</h2>
      <p><em>Please read the <a href="#">Line Ebook</a> before starting this assignment.</em></p>
      <p>Using the element of line and the principles learned thus far in Design and Communication, you will create images that interpret a series of abstract style through the use of contour, edge, negative space, and line. The images themselves will be an abstracted composition; the content will be made visual by the character and placements of the lines, shapes, edges, and contours.</p>
      <p>You will create graphic images that best express the visual rhythms in themes of <strong>Geometric</strong> and <strong>Organic</strong>. Consider the character of the theme, and match your rhythmic and line style to it. You will need to create balanced compositions that have rhythm, no focal point and are unified. You may wish to begin each problem by creating compositions that utilize black/white/gray only of hard edged straight lines and curves. Use the line tool, pencil tool or pen tool to create lines. If you have a tablet and a stylus pen, you may use a pressure sensitive brush to create lines as well. <a href="#">Use the provided template to create your concepts.</a></p>
      <p>Below are some ideas to keep in mind while working through the assignment:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Symmetrical, vertical and horizontal is stable and calming.</li>
        <li>Asymmetrical and diagonal are active and aggressive.</li>
        <li>Unity can be achieved by repetition, rhythm, similarity, or continuity.</li>
        <li>Emphasis can be created by contrast, placement or isolation</li>
        <li>Rhythm can be achieved by linear repetition and by repeated marks.</li>
        <li>Balance can be achieved by creating balancing the visual weights within the image.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You will create a minimum of 4 sketches for each selected variable on templates provided.</p>
      <p>Look at the photographic artist James Welling as an influence for your images <a href="#" target="_blank">James Welling PDF</a> or <a href="http://jameswelling.net/" target="_blank">http://jameswelling.net/</a>. The works included in the PDF are Welling&#x2019;s work completed between 1990-2014. We will also be looking at the artist Brice <a href="#" target="_blank">Marden Brice Marden PDF</a> or <a href="http://www.matthewmarks.com/new-york/artists/brice-marden" target="_blank">www.matthewmarks.com/new-york/artists/brice-marden</a> as an influence for your images. Marden is also a renowned experimental image maker, creating the images we are looking at here as paintings 1990-2012.</p>

      <h2>SOFTWARE TIPS</h2>
      <p>For this exercise the Paintbrush tool will work the best. If you have a Wacom or Graphire pad and stylus remember this tool is pressure sensitive, the harder you push the thicker the line. You might practice with this a bit before beginning work on the exercise. The paintbrush tool is located as indicated. If you leave the cursor setting on top of the tools a pop up will show up identifying the tool. You will work with the grayscale palette indicated, no colors please, and you will probably wish to work in layers again, with the new layer button indicated. To move the layers around use the Move tool as you have in previous exercises.</p>

      <p>You can adjust the size of the brush by going to the brush size area of the Options palette.</p>

      <p>These instructions will help you get started on this assignment. Please refer to the Photoshop Resources page for more Photoshop help. You can always send me an email or ask for help on the discussion forum if you run into problems. </p>

      <h2>SUBMITTING WORK</h2>
      <h3>ARTWORK</h3>
      <p>When finished with your designs, create a flattened .jpg file format. You can then upload the files in the <a href="#">Lesson 7 dropbox</a>. In total you will submit 2 image file for this assignment, along with your written self-assessment in D2L. For example, I would save my files as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>bennettc_geometric.jpg</li>
        <li>bennettc_organic.jpg</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>ANALYSIS</h3>
      <p>Each week, you will be asked to respond to questions regarding your artwork created for each project. Please fill out the self-directed analysis, by answering the questions below when submitting your work in D2L.</p>
      <p><em>Hint: sometimes D2L gets twitchy so I recommend writing your answers in your favorite text editor (Word, Google Docs, etc.) and then copy/paste into the D2L comment box.</em></p>
      <p><strong>Self-Directed Analysis:</strong></p>
      <ol>
        <li>Explain how the principles and elements of design were used to create unified linear images.</li>
        <li>Explain which principles of the Gestalt theory have been used and where they were used in your concepts.</li>
        <li>Does the image meet the project parameters? Please explain the the specific type of lines that were used and how they help to express the chosen topics?</li>
        <li>What alternatives did you consider while doing this project?</li>
      </ol>
      <p><em>Hint: These are terms that should be used in your analysis: contour, repetition, movement, gesture, lost and found edges, line quality, unity/harmony</em></p>

    </div>

    <div class='col-half-right'>
      <h3>CRITIQUE</h3>
      <p>You will create a new post on the <a href="#">Lesson 7 Discussion Forum</a>. In this post you will upload the .jpg versions of your design and then tell us a little bit about what you created. You don&#x2019;t need to give the full formal breakdown that you wrote out in the analysis, however I would like you to use the vocab to explain what you were trying to do and if you think you were successful.</p>
      <p>As a way to continue your learning and appreciation of the concepts, you will read and respond to at least two of your classmate&#x2019;s posts. It helps to see how they responded to the same design prompts you were working with. Your critique may help them to see the ideas in a different light. Plus this is another chance for you to use the vocabulary in a slightly different context.</p>
      <p>At the very least, answer the following questions: Was the design successful in creating a graphic image that communicates the meaning of the concepts? How was this achieved? What is working particularly well in the design?</p>

      <h2>EVALUATION</h2>
      <p>The project is worth 20 points.</p>
      <p>The evaluation is based on:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>ORGANIZATION / FORMAT: Imagery is organized in a clear, appropriate and precise manner. Images are unified by repetition, rhythm, similarity, and/or continuity. 3 points.</li>
        <li>EMPHASIS: Imagery does not have a clearly defined focal point. 2 points.</li>
        <li>BALANCE: A correct interpretation of symmetrical, asymmetrical, and radial balance. Imagery engages the picture plane. 2 points.</li>
        <li>RHYTHM: Internal design dynamics support the intended imagery. Rhythm is present through repetition of lines, shapes, or negative space. 3 points</li>
        <li>LINE QUALITY: Line varies in thickness and value. Line dynamically supports content of image being presented. 7 points.</li>
        <li>SELF-DIRECTED ANALYSIS: A thoughtful evaluation of relevant issues correctly using the language of design. 3 points</li>
      </ul>
      <p><em>Note the discussion forum posts and critiques are part of a separate assignment grade.</em></p>
