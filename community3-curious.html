      <p>As a reminder, these weekly community design challenges are all about
        sharing ideas and explorations with each other. More importantly, they
        are about cultivating your own artistic sensibilities. They encourage
        you to be curious about the world around you and to look with fresh eyes
        at things that seem familiar.</p>
      <p>An important part of being an artist is connecting with your world,
        connecting with the muse, connecting with your curiosity. As artists, we
        deal directly with true experience and capture our adventures in some
        sort of tangible form to share with others. Our recorded experiences
        communicate the adventure and can take on the form of paintings, music,
        sketches, drawings, doodles, patterns, rhythms, dance, film, animation,
        etc. The experiences themselves can be physical adventures, emotional
        explorations, conceptual play, etc. Often times, the artistic
        experiential journey is one that delves into the unknown. It is an act
        of personal discovery.</p>
      <p>Your assignment for this artistâ€™s date is to simply <strong>BE
          CURIOUS!</strong> I want you to go discover something new about your
        world.</p>

      <h3>IDEAS</h3>
      <p>These can be as complex or as simple as you want to make it.</p>
      <p>You can go hang out at a book store or library and look up something in
        a book. Technically, you could use the internet to find out new facts,
        but how boring is that? Force yourself out into the world. It isn't that
        scary.</p>
      <p>This can also be experiential. You could go somewhere you've never been
        before. Take a drive down that one road you always pass and wonder
        about. Maybe go to a restaurant you've never been to before or visit
        your favorite restaurant and try something new off the menu. You get the
        idea.</p>

      <p>A fun example. A student many years ago decided to try out pistachios.
        She had always been scared of eating them because they are green and who
        wants to eat green food? Her grandma always made pistachio pudding and
        it always looked like green slime to her. Why would you eat that? So
        this girl went to the bulk-food store and bought $1 worth of pistachios.
        She sat in her car, built up her courage, and tried them. Turns out they
        are <strong>amazing</strong>. She came to class with five pounds of
        pistachios to share with everyone. So much fun.</p>

      <h2>NOTES</h2>
      <p>If your parents or significant others ask why you are going out to
        play, tell them it is for homework. If they don't believe you, show them
        this assignment page as proof.</p>
      <p><strong>Obligatory Warning:</strong> this in no way gives you
        permission to go do something illegal, immoral, or potentially dangerous
        for your assignment. Please do not get arrested or sent to the hospital
        because you are doing something stupid.</p>

      <h2>ASSIGNMENT SUBMISSION</h2>
      <p>To turn in your assignment, you will simply write a post on <a
          href="#">the discussion forum</a> <em>(Communication tab)</em> telling
        us what you did and how it went. It would be great if you have some
        tangible, visual documentation to share. It could be a photo or a
        drawing or even a visual poem. Let the experience inspire you.</p>
      <p>I'm not requiring anyone to post comments on each others work, but feel
        free to compliment and support each other. It is that sense of community
        that we're trying to build. Do what you can to participate in the
        community conversation.</p>

      <h2>ASSIGNMENT EVALUATION</h2>
      <p>I'm not going to grade these. I'm just going to enjoy them. I might
        give some feedback. Mostly, I just want you to make something. You get
        full points for making and sharing them.</p>
