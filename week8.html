      <p>Hello all.</p>
      <p>We are almost at the end of the course. I hope you have enjoyed your creative summer. This is a reminder to please do a course evaluation. <a href="https://lcc.campuslabs.com/courseeval/">You can get to the evaluations here.</a> This lets both me and the school know how things went and what can be done to make the course even better in the future. Thanks in advance for your feedback.</p>
      <p>Now that you've finished the final project, all that you have left is to take the final exam and to post (and comment) on a final discussion forum.</p>
      <p>I hope it has been a fun summer for you and that you learned a few things about design and communication.</p>
      <p><strong>final exam and final discussion forum are due by Thursday July 30</strong></p>

      <h2>FINAL EXAM REVIEW</h2>
      <p><strong><a href="#">The final exam is now available.</a></strong> It is a departmental exam that everyone in ARTS 102 takes regardless of teacher or course delivery method. It is 70 questions, vocabulary-based, multiple-choice, open-book, and open-note. There is a two-hour limit for taking the exam so you won't have time to go in unprepared and expect to look up every answer. It is worth taking the time to review the course content before you take the test.</p>
      <p>Here are some resources to help you review:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>the ebooks from each unit have all the vocabulary and concepts</li>
        <li><a href="#">this list of vocab terms to understand</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://quizlet.com/_4bn93p" target="_blank">flashcards and video games at quizlet</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.cram.com/flashcards/arts-102-final-exam-vocab-review-9448733" target="_blank">flashcards and video games at cram</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.classtools.net/arcade/201801_BEGkk7" target="_blank">really bad (but useful) videogames at classtools.net</a></li>
        <li>kahoot! not sure how well this works for individual review, but they are quite fun in my face-to-face classes. to do this right, you will need two devices, one to run the games and one to use for playing the games. maybe you can get a friend to help? warning, there are some completely random silly zingers in the games to throw off the students.<ul>

      <h2>FINAL DISCUSSION FORUM</h2>
      <p>This <a href="#">final discussion forum</a> is a way to wrap up the course by showing off what you learned this summer. It is a way to bring closure to the course for yourself and your classmates. This one is slightly more involved than just posting your artwork, though, so be sure to read the assignment details closely.</p>
      <p>As always, be sure to comment on at least two other people's posts.</p>
