      <h2>OBJECTIVES</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Begin to visually communicate range of VALUE in a composition</li>
        <li>Use research to communicate an artistâ€™s style</li>
        <li>To continue to develop Photoshop/software skills.</li>

      <h2>ASSIGNMENT</h2>
      <p><em>Please read the <a href="#" target="_blank">Value Ebook</a> before starting this assignment.</em></p>
      <p>This Lesson has two design parts, both will be created in the same design template:</p>
    </div>

    <div class="col-half-left">
      <h3>PART A</h3>
      <p>For the first part of this assignment, you will create a value scale with a total of 8 values:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Open the template provided.</li>
        <li>Fill your provided value scale with 8 tones of value (your choice of 1 single color or black/gray/white).</li>
        <li>You will use your value scale to complete Part 2 of the Assignment.</li>
        <li>Remember that Value refers the degree of lightness or darkness.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Examples of value scales:</p>
      <figure><img alt="value scales" src="valueScale.png"></figure>
      <p>Your value scale may include more low key (darker) or more high key (lighter) values than my examples, but try for a full range of values in your scale.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="col-half-right">
      <h3>PART B</h3>
      <p>The second part of this assignment is to create an abstract cubist design in the style of Stuart Davis.</p>
      <ol start="2">
        <li>Research Stuart Davis - history and collection of works.</li>
        <li>Make a few thumbnail sketches or rough drafts before working on the template just to get a sense of where you would like to go with the art.</li>
        <li>Create your design with a variety of geometric and organic shapes in the style of his work.</li>
        <li>Make your final design in the large rectangle on the provided template.</li>
        <li>Vary the size and placement.</li>
        <li>Shade in all your shapes with the different values you developed on your scale.<ul>
            <li>You may choose a single color, such as red, green or black for your value scale.</li>
            <li>Use only the values you have developed on your value scale for your design.</li>
            <li>Overlap shapes on your cubism design for added interest.</li>
            <li>Use your full range of value developed on the scale.</li>
            <li>Balance your image with good placement of visual weight.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Save your completed template as a .jpg file with the usual naming convention.</li>
        <li>Upload to the Value assignment folder provided in D2L.</li>
      </ol>
    </div>

    </div>
    <div class='col-half-left'>
      <h2>SUBMITTING WORK</h2>
      <h3>ARTWORK</h3>
      <p>When finished with your designs, create flattened .jpg files. You can then upload the files in the <a href="#" target="_blank">Lesson 9 dropbox</a>. In total you will submit 1 image file for this assignment. For example, I would save my file as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>bennettc_value.jpg</li>
      </ul>


      <h3>ANALYSIS</h3>
      <p>Each week, you will be asked to respond to questions regarding your artwork created for each project. Please fill out the self-directed analysis, by answering the questions below when submitting your work in D2L.</p>
      <p><em>Hint: sometimes D2L gets twitchy so I recommend writing your answers in your favorite text editor (Word, Google Docs, etc.) and then copy/paste into the D2L comment box.</em></p>
      <p><strong>Self-Directed Analysis:</strong></p>
      <ol start="2">
        <li>Tell me something you discovered about Stuart Davis or his work that interested you.</li>
        <li>How did you use balance in your composition? How did you use shape?</li>
        <li>What do you like about your finished art?</li>
        <li>What can you do better next time?</li>
      </ol>
      <p><em>Hint: These are terms that should be used in your analysis: value, high-key, low-key</em></p>

    </div>

    <div class='col-half-right'>
      <h3>CRITIQUE</h3>
      <p>You will create a new post on the <a href="#" target="_blank">Lesson 9 Discussion Forum</a>. In this post you will upload the .jpg versions of your design and then tell us a little bit about what you created. I would like you to use the vocab to explain what you were trying to do and if you think you were successful.</p>
      <p>As a way to continue your learning and appreciation of the concepts, you will read and respond to at least two of your classmate's posts. It helps to see how they responded to the same design prompts you were working with. Your critique may help them to see the ideas in a different light. Plus this is another chance for you to use the vocabulary in a slightly different context.</p>
      <p>At the very least, answer the following questions: Was the design successful in creating a graphic image that communicates the meaning of the concepts? How was this achieved? What is working particularly well in the design?</p>

      <h2>EVALUATION</h2>
      <p>The project is worth 20 points.</p>
      <p>The evaluation is based on:</p>
      <p><strong>PART A:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>One value scale is complete, with 8 tones of a single color. 8 pts.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>PART B:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>ORGANIZATION/FORMAT: Imagery is organized in a clear, appropriate and precise manner. Composition utilizes an equal distribution of visual weigh, allowing the imagery to feel balanced.Shapes are unified by repetition, rhythm, similarity, and/or continuity. 10 pts.</li>
        <li>SELF ASSESSMENT: Thoughtful evaluation of relevant issues correctly using the language of design. 2 pts.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><em>Note the discussion forum posts and critiques are part of a separate assignment grade.</em></p>
