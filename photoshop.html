      <h2>GETTING PHOTOSHOP</h2>
      <p>You will be using Adobe Photoshop to complete the design assignments in this class. Using your LCC email, <a href='https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud/buy/students.html' target="_blank" title="opens in new tab" rel="noopener">you can get a subscription for about $10 a month</a>. </p>
      
      <p>If you cannot purchase Photoshop (or do not want to) a wonderful alternative to Photoshop is <a href="https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/designer/"  target="_blank" title="opens in new tab" rel="noopener">Affinity Designer</a>. A free 90-day trial is available during the pandemic which will be enough to get you through this course. There is an iPad app version as well.</p>

      <p>If you have decent bandwidth, you can also use <a href="https://www.photopea.com/"  target="_blank" title="opens in new tab" rel="noopener">Photopea</a>, an online browser-based alternative that looks and acts very much like Photoshop. You can even create and edit in Photoshop's native .psd file format. It is a free tool, but if you want to add more features, you can subscribe for about $3 a month.</p>

      <h2>USING PHOTOSHOP</h2>
      <p>Photoshop is a beast of a program. It can be scary when you first open it up. It can be even scarier when you run into a problem and don&#39;t know how to fix it. In a classroom setting it is easy for me to show you how to do something or how to dig out of a hole. Unfortunately, I can&#39;t easily do that for you in an online-only setting. There may be some frustrations involved, but we will work through it together. </p>
      <p>Each assignment will have basic instructions on how to complete the assigned tasks. The instructions aren&#39;t overly deep or complex, although they should be enough to help you get started. </p>
      <p>Here are additional resources that may help with Photoshop:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>You can send me an email <em>(Communication tab)</em> through the class site to ask for help. I will try to get back to you as soon as I can. <strong>This isn&#39;t the best option</strong>. </li>
        <li>You can send an email to our Learning Assistant<em>(Communication tab)</em> through the class site to ask for help.<strong> This is a better option</strong>. </li>
        <li>There is a <a href='#'>discussion forum</a> <em>(use the link or go to the Communication tab)</em> where you can ask for help from me and from your classmates. <strong>This is a better option</strong> because your classmates may be able to answer quicker than me. Plus, someone may have already asked the same question and gotten an answer. </li>
        <li><a href='https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLf0N3CF2JlRx7o9oVObgk4y5X6WBF_g21' target="_blank" title="opens in new tab" rel="noopener">Photoshop Course: Tools In-Depth</a> is a great youtube series that shows you how quickly how to use the tools. </li>
        <li><a href='https://www.lynda.com' target="_blank" title="opens in new tab" rel="noopener">Lynda.com</a> is a wonderful resource for video tutorials. There is a subscription fee to access the videos, however access is available to <a href='https://www.cadl.org' target="_blank" title="opens in new tab" rel="noopener">Capital Area District Libraries (CADL)</a> members for free with a valid library card.</li>
        <li>If nothing else, <a href='https://mister-chad.com/post/photoshop/' target="_blank" title="opens in new tab" rel="noopener">this Learn Photoshop post</a> gives you links to many more learning resources. </li>
