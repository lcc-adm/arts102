      <h2>getting photoshop (or not)</h2>
      <p>This course is built on the premise that you will using Adobe Photoshop
        to complete the design assignments in this class. Using your LCC email,
        <a href="https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud/buy/students.html"
          target="_blank" title="opens in new tab">you can
          get a subscription for about $10 a month</a>.</p>
      <p>The focus of this course is on exploring design concepts and what you
        say with them. The creative tools you choose to use for crafting your
        visual statements are a personal choice. I fully encourage you to
        explore alternatives based on your financial, technical, and creative
        paradigms. I will try to help with technical support as best as I can,
        however I may not be able to find solutions for you.</p>

      <h2>using photoshop</h2>
      <p>Photoshop is a beast of a program. It can be scary when you first open
        it up. It can be even scarier when you run into a problem and don't know
        how to fix it. In a classroom setting it is easy for me to show you how
        to do something or how to dig out of a hole. Unfortunately, I can't
        easily do that for you in an online-only setting. There may be some
        frustrations involved, but we will work through it together.</p>
      <p>Each assignment will have basic instructions on how to complete the
        assigned tasks. The instructions aren't overly deep or complex, although
        they should be enough to help you get started.</p>
      <p>Here are additional resources that may help with Photoshop:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>You can send me an email <em>(Communication tab)</em> through the
          class site to ask for help. I will try to get back to you as soon as I
          can. <strong>This isn't the best option</strong>.</li>
        <li>There is a <a href="#">discussion forum</a> <em>(use the link or go
            to the Communication tab)</em> where you can ask for help from me
          and from your classmates. <strong>This is a better option</strong>
          because your classmates may be able to answer quicker than me. Plus,
          someone may have already asked the same question and gotten an answer.
        </li>
