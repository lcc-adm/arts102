      <p>The design exercises are meant as explorations of how the principles
        and elements can be used to develop the projects. You will be creating
        different pieces exploring specific ideas. The hope is that by focusing
        on the different ideas that you will discover the best way to illustrate
        your projects.</p>
      <p>These are meant to be studies and explorations for the projects. Quick
        and rough low-fidelity explorations of how you <em>could</em> go about
        making your final images. These are not meant to be beautiful or
        perfect, they are simply meant to explore possibilities. This is a
        process of curiosity and play, experimentation and discovery. The
        lessons learned here will be used to build the actual digital collages
        for the project.</p>
      <p>Think of this as working in your sketchbook as you plan out your
        design.</p>

      <h3>visual exploration</h3>
      <p>Forms these explorations can take include, but are not limited to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>play with arrangement of elements through physical collage of
          elements</li>
        <li>draw out different arrangement possibilities</li>
        <li>make color studies of compositional ideas</li>
        <li>emulate ideas from collage research</li>
        <li>experiment with different art media like markers, paint, crayons
        </li>
        <li>print out and color on top of digital images</li>
        <li>cut up and assemble construction paper shapes</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="col-half-right">
      <h3>analysis of the exploration</h3>
      <p>Written analysis of what was made and what was learned. Your writing
        doesn't need to be formal or very long. I'm not going to worry about
        spelling and grammar (although you should). Just tell me (and yourself)
        what you did and what you learned. Please include vocab related to the
        design principles.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="col-full topline">
      <h2>ASSIGNMENT SUBMISSION &amp; EVALUATION</h2>
      <p>Your explorations will probably take different forms. That's OK. Simply
        scan or photograph them and upload as a group of files to our shared
        Google folder. Your written work can be created as a Google Doc and
        placed in the same folder.</p>
      <p>Although there may be some overlap in the files, an individual grade
        will be given for each of the principles.</p>
