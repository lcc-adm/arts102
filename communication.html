      <p>As we have already discussed in the Introduction chapter, communication is a package of messages. When we talk about visual communication, we are not only talking about traditional art work, such as drawing or painting, but we are talking about messages that are created through the means of graphic design, web design, photography, animation and film that can be found in advertising and entertainment as well.</p>
      <p>As we continue to explore the communication process, we will define communication terms in the traditional sense, meaning verbal communication, and relate those terms to visual communication.</p>
      <p>Successful communication is important to ensure that one’s message is clearly understood. But even more important is remembering that communication is so much more that just a verbal act, in terms of mass communication, we now live in a period of transition between words and images.</p>

        <h2>Communication</h2>
        <p>(1) The process or act of communicating; (2) the actual message or messages sent and received; (3) the study of processes involved in the sending and receiving of messages. </p>
        <p><em>Definition from the text book Essential of Human Communication, fourth edition, Joseph A. DeVito © 2002</em></p>
        <p>In order to better understand this process, there are several terms that are crucial to define and understand so that we are able to relate them to verbal communication as well as visual communication. </p>
      </section>

      <section class="white-box padded">
        <h2>Source / Receiver</h2>
        <p>Each person involved in a communication is both a source/sender (or a speaker, or in the case of visual communication, an artist) and a receiver (or a listener, or in the case of visual communication, a person viewing the artist’s creation.</p>
        <p>When we speak to someone, words are used and non-verbal gestures are made to communicate a message. The person listening, interprets the message and gives verbal and non-verbal cues back to the speaker so that it is understood that the message has been communicated, whether it be a clear or unclear message.</p>

      <section class="white-box padded">
        <h2>Encoding / Decoding</h2>
        <p>Encoding is the process of putting ones ideas into speech, or a code. In visual communication, encoding is the process of putting one’s idea, or a particular message (in advertising), into a visual form that sends a message without the verbal cues.</p>
        <p>Decoding is the process of interpreting the verbal cues and taking them out of the code (speech) to apply meaning. In visual communication, the receiver is interpreting a code of symbols or design principles or element to apply meaning. For example a composition that is primarily made up of horizontal lines and a blue hue will visually communicate a message that contains a sense of calmness.</p>

      <section class="white-box padded">
        <h2>Message</h2>
        <p>A message is the “stuff” of the communication. The “what” that is being communicated. In visual communication, the message refers to the subject of the painting, the imagery of the photograph, or the images in a stream of video. These are just a few examples of a message that might be communicated through visual imagery. Can you think of other messages that utilize visuals to communicate?</p>
      </section>

      <section class="white-box padded">
        <h2>Feedback</h2>
        <p>Feeback is information that is given back to the source. Feedback may come from the source’s own message (as when we hear what we are saying) or from the receiver(s) in the form of applause, yawning, confused looks, questions.. etc.</p>
        <p><em>Definition from the text book Essential of Human Communication, fourth edition, Joseph A. DeVito © 2002</em></p>
        <p>In visual communication, feedback can refer to the response an artist gets from an artwork. It can pertain to the way someone responds to an advertisment or a movie. Feedback in visual communication can also refer to the popularity of a video game, based on the success of it’s graphics or the success of a web site based on the use of color and a pleasing layout that helps make the web site easy to navigate.</p>

        <h2>Channel</h2>
        <p>The Channel refers to the means in which a message is communicated. You may communicate in a face to face conversation, or a telephone call, or an email. In visual communication, you send your message through visuals, whether it be through an advertisement, a photograph, a drawing, or an animation. Can you think of other channels that might use a visual to communicate a message?</p>
      </section>

      <section class="white-box padded">
        <h2>Noise</h2>
        <p>Noise refers to anything that interferes with the sender’s message. Noise can be internal or external. Internal noise refers to one’s own mind, for example, worrying about what else needs to be done that day, rather than focusing on the current moment. External noise, for example, may be the noise that is happening outside the classroom that interferes with a student’s ability to hear and concentrate on the lecture or discussion taking place.</p>
        <p>In visual communication, noise refers to an unclear message. Perhaps the visuals in a composition are not rendered precisely, or maybe the elements in use do not look as if they belong together, which result in a mixed message, or a visual message that is not clearly communicated.</p>

      <section class="white-box padded">
        <h2>Context</h2>
        <p>Communication Context refers to the physical, psychological, social and temporal environment in which a communication takes place. The context will influence the communication and have an impact on the message that is being communicated.</p>
        <p>In visual communication the context refers to the manner in which the message is being communicated. For example, is the message being communicated through color and symbols in a painting?, or is it more effective to use a digitally designed poster? The answer all depends on the message being communicated and who the intended audience.</p>
        <p>We will now look at the four aspects of context that have a
          direct relation to the success of a communication. </p>
        <p><em>Definition of context types from the text book Essential of Human Communication, fourth edition, Joseph A. DeVito © 2002</em></p>
        <h3>Physical Context</h3>
        <p>Physical context refers to the tangible or concrete environment, the location, a classroom, the park, the art gallery or the theater; you don’t talk the same way at a rock concert as you do a school library. In visual communication, you would not expect to see the same imagery at a rock concert as a professional business conference.</p>
        <h3>Cultural Context</h3>
        <p>Cultural context refers to the lifestyles, beliefs, values, behavior and communication of the group; it is the rules of a group of people for considering something right or wrong.</p>
        <h3>Social-psychological</h3>
        <p>Social-psychological context refers to the status relationships among speakers, the formality of the situation; you don’t talk the same way in the cafeteria as you would at a formal dinner at your boss’s house.</p>
        <h3>Temporal Context</h3>
        <p>Temporal context refers to the position in which a message fits into a sequence of events; you don’t talk the same way after someone tells of the death of a close relative as you do after someone tells of winning the lottery. </p>
