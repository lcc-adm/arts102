                <h2>THE PRINCIPLE OF UNITY IN VISUAL COMMUNICATION</h2>
            </div>

            <div class="col-double-right">
                <p>There are very few hard and fast rules in visual
                    communication;
                    multiple correct options exist to effectively relate your
                    message and have it understood. However, the principle of
                    Unity exists in all successful design. <strong>Unity, also
                        referred to as harmony, is a state where a degree of
                        agreement exists among the different elements of the
                        artwork, a pleasing combination of parts that make up a
                        whole composition.</strong> A unified message is
                    organized. Imagery must be organized if the audience is to
                    understand and remember it.</p>

                <p>The principle of unity is perhaps the most important of the
                    design principles, yet it is often the most difficult to
                    understand. Unity is the fundamental principle of design and
                    it is supported by all the other principles. If a design is
                    not unified, it cannot be considered successful.</p>

                <p>Unity creates an integrated image in which all the elements
                    are working together to support the design as a whole, and
                    is
                    based
                    on the gestalt theory of visual perception, which states
                    that
                    the eye of the viewer seeks a gestalt or unified whole. This
                    means that the viewer is actually looking for a connection
                    between the elements, for some sort of organization, for
                    unity
                    in the design.</p>

                <p>A gestalt is created because the mind simplifies and
                    organizes
                    information. It does this by grouping elements together to
                    create new wholes. Understanding how the mind groups
                    elements
                    (by proximity, similarity, continuation and alignment) helps
                    us
                    understand how unity can be achieved. We will cover Gestalt
                    theory simply here a bit later and in greater depth in a
                    subsequent chapter.</p>

                <p>No element of the message is independent of any other
                    element.
                    Each element influences and is influenced by the other
                    existing
                    elements in a message. As we move further into the course we
                    will discover how different design elements and principles
                    affect a visual message. Powerful, directed, and easily
                    understood messages can be delivered when all elements and
                    principles are working together to present factual,
                    emotional,
                    psychological, and persuasive information the designer
                    wishes
                    communicated. In order for this multi-layered communication
                    to
                    be successful the imagery must be presented in a cohesive
                    format
                    that does not detract from the message through mixed
                    messages,
                    noise, distraction, or the lack of a structured statement.
                    Achieving visual unity promotes effective visual
                    communication.
                    There are multiple ways of visually organizing elements. We
                    will
                    touch on these in the next few pages.</p>

            <p>An arrangement of similar or related objects or content in a
                composition. Themes have power. They can unify help to unify an
                image in addition to visual elements such as gestalt through the
                interrelated thematic content they present. However, scattering
                a lot of similar objects around the picture plane does not
                ensure thematic unity. The objects must look as if they have a
                reason to be there and are sharing space for a reason.</p>

            <p>Themes can be be deep and profound, such as love or war, but can
                also be mundane and still maintain a beautiful visual unity and
                message. In the images above by photographer Jan Groover, you
                will note the content theme is that of kitchen utensils and
                objects, yet by arrangements of the objects together with their
                united purpose a powerful and harmonious set of images is
                created.</p>

            <p>About the artist: “Jan Groover’s relentlessly formal still lifes
                of mundane objects brought a sense of Renaissance stateliness to
                postmodern photographyInstead of feast tables or objects in the
                rooms of the wealthy, the still-life tableaus that first brought
                Ms. Groover to prominence in the late 1970s focused on the
                everyday implements of the kitchen, arranged in the sink: fork
                tines, spatulas, butter-knife blades, whorled and scalloped cake
                pans, shot in such a way as to confound perspective and to
                transform light into a kind of object itself in the reflective
                surfaces."</p>

            <p>"The pictures resonated not only as subtle documents of feminism
                but also as unusually beautiful investigations of the fictions
                that are inseparable from facts in the conventions of
                photography.” - Randy Kennedy, NY Times, January 11, 2012</p>
